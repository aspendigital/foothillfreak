              Here is the super gnarly massive avalanche that was going to bury
                us all, but suddenly stopped instead.

              Here we see helm&uuml;t looking for gear to add to his collection
              after Dan was taken out by the avalanche, but fortunately everyone
              survived and no gear was inherited.

              Here we are on our second jaunt up to the granite glacier on day
                6. This trek was fuelled by anxiety to find out what happened
                to the rest of our group, who radioed with
                the news that someone had fallen into a crevasse. I took this
                picture because there was a particularly eerie light shining
                on the ice fall, making it look like an ominous, ancient spine,
                reminding me of this scene from an entirely different planet:<br />

                crevasse, possibly even communicating with Julie, some 60 ft
                below. Notice the ski track at the bottom of the pict going into
                the crevasse. (photo Matthias)

              It was  incredible how quickly help
                came to our secluded glacier playground. There wasn't
                enough room to park  on the steep rollover between
                crevasses, but the pilot didn't seem to mind. (photo Matthias)

              With the stress of the day still in the back of everyone's mind,
              the decision was made to celebrate Far Left's birthday a day early.
              This was a good call!!!
