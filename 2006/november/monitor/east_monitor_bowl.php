            <h1>Monitor Bowl Dawn Patrol Suffering and Fetid Sunscreen Adventure </h1>
            <h6>Wednesday, November 15th, 2006</h6>
            <p>Finally, I found another sucker to go verting and snowboarding
              with me: Helmut, a ski buddy who continually reminded me, &quot;if we
              were on skis, we'd be there by now&quot;, then later in the day, &quot;we'd
              of had 2 more runs by now if we were on skis!&quot;. </p>
            <p>I don't  mind tho, as I believe
              that in early season it's best to go slow and suffer. I figure
              that the slower I go up a thin snowpack, the fewer runs I'll take,
              avoiding certain potential for injury on the way down. Early season
              suffering is like a tribute to my early years of learning to backcountry
              ski in painfully unflexing leather boots and masochistically long
              skis. So by flailing about early season on snowshoes that fall
              off and a delaminated snowboard from the early 90's, I'll really
              appreciate my holy and beloved AT setup when I start to use them,
              hopefully sometime very soon... </p>
            <p>Although the riding
              was quite good, the most noteworthy event of the day was the
              sunscreen. </p>
            <p>Discovered in the bottom of Helmut's ancient russack
              was an equally ancient, sorry little tube of sunscreen. We had
              to squeeze like hell to get the only remaining dregs out to protectively
              smear all over our noses, which we instantly regretted. Once rubbed
              in, the cream began to eminate a most hideous stench,
              and we simultaneously realized that it had gone completely rancid. </p>
            <p>If you're ever find yourself backcountry skiing with sunscreen
              smeared all over your face, and for some reason you suddenly want
              to take the sunscreen off, here's a little tip: you can't. </p>
            <p>And
              if you ever find your face smeared with rotten sun cream that smells
              remarkably like somebodies neglected gym shorts post eliptical
              training marathon, you have two options: either wait it out, or
              start hiking like a mad man in the full blazing sun with all your
              clothes on in attempt to create your own funk in hopes of drowning
              out the fetid cloud of moldy sunscreen off-gass. I tried both of
              these options, yet it was still about an hour and a half until
              I found some sort of reprieve.</p>
            <p>Too bad we completely used up the last drops as  that
              sunscreen would have really come in handy on a bright and sunny
              April 1st ski tour...</p>

            &quot;This would be a lot easier on skis.&quot; </p>
