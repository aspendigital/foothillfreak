            <h1>Dawn Patrol to Bear Trap </h1>
            <h6>Wednesday, November 29th, 2006</h6>
            <p>It was cold.</p>
            <p>Really cold.</p>
            <p>The thermometer outside of the Pug Patrol Chalet at Silverfork
              said -5 f. It didn't seem too bad for the first couple of minutes,
              but it wasnt' long until the thumbs and nose started to go numb,
              and the eyelashes started to stick together.</p>
            <p>As we hiked for the first few hours, the slighest
              change in terrain features and/or exposure to moving air would
              drastically change how cold it felt, and wether you could use your
              fingers or feel your nose. I was constantly reminding myself to
              breath through my mouth as inhaling through my nostrils would quickly
              make it painfully cold. Maybe it's just my big nose... </p>
            <p>Skiing was, as expected, slow. We turned down the prospect
              of getting on anything steep as it was too cold to dig a snow
              pit, or to even think about it.  </p>

            <p>It's a no brainer... Beartrap  after a snow storm. Helmut stokes
              the furnace. </p>
