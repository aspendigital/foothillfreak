            <h1>Mount Adams, South West Chute, Avalanche Glacier. </h1>
            <h6>Day 2, July 2nd, 2006</h6>
            <p>See the other days: <a href="mount_adams.php">day 1</a> &bull; <a href="mount_adams_2.php">day
            2</a> &bull; <a href="mount_adams_3.php">day 3</a></p>
            <p>Day two Fu and I went up to the true summit while the princess
              did a lap off Pikers peak. Then we met up on the false summit and
              skied the south west chute along with some friends. Warm temps
              made for funky snow. It was so unsupportable in spots that it clearly
              reminded me of the wasatch in spring, but the lines were still
              mindblowingly long and beautimus. Fu get's top kudos for skiing
              the chute top to bottom in one shot, all 3,500 ft of it! </p>

            Fu traversing off the summit of Mount Adams. A small portion of the
              constant supply of climbers pictured on the horizon. </p>

            <p>
            While the south climb is quite tame, looking off Mount Adams to the
              east is very exciting. The steep slopes are heavily cravassed and
              broken. </p>

            Fu skis a fun line from the summit on a south east facing ridge. </p>

            The Princess smiling for some reason, about to drop into the SouthWest
              Chute.. </p>

              The Princess breathing heavily.. <br />

            <p>
            Looking back on the South West Chute.. As incredibly long as it is,
              it's still over way too soon, leaving you with that feeling you
              get when you finish a great book that you never wanted to end. </p>
