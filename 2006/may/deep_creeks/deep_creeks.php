            <h1>Deep Creeks</h1>
            <h6>May 6th to the 8th, 2006</h6>
            <p class="caption">Up the Deep Creeks with skis but no paddle.</p>

            <p>This is where we could first see snow, after hiking for 20 minutes. Gulp... </p>
            		
            <img src="DSC01998.jpg" alt="Deep Creeks Skiing" width="600" height="465" />
            <p>There's nothing like an all day hike with a little skiing thrown in...</p>

			<p>Fu and the Princess, still smiling.</p>

			<p>Fu, Princess, Star Child, and Morning Glory. We got suckered into putting
			    our ski boots on too early by a snowy bench, and ended up hiking
			    a steep mile on dirt, hoping the whole way that snow would be around the
			    next corner.</p>
			
		    
			<img src="DSC02005.jpg" alt="Deep Creeks Skiing" width="600" height="448" />
			<p>Are you getting the feeling that we did a lot of hiking on dirt???</p>
			
		    
			<img src="DSC02010.jpg" alt="Deep Creeks Skiing" width="600" height="497" />
			<p>Sweet Cheeks prowls by the stand of Bristle Cone Pines.</p>
			
		    
			<img src="DSC02020.jpg" alt="Deep Creeks Skiing" width="600" height="450" />
			<p>Ahhh, Ze Summit at last!</p>
			
		    
			<img src="DSC02021.jpg" alt="Deep Creeks Skiing" width="600" height="450" />
			<p>On the summit Sweet Cheeks claimed ownership with a triumphant pee on the
		    high point cairn.</p>
			
		    
			<img src="DSC02033.jpg" alt="Deep Creeks Skiing" width="600" height="481" />
			<p>Star Child finds a soft spot after a long day. I
			    wish I had taken more pictures of our camp because it was really
			    quite wonderful.</p>
			
		    
			<img src="DSC02035.jpg" alt="Deep Creeks Skiing" width="600" height="455" />
			<p>Wilderness study areas were conviently marked by
			    flattened signage. Other than a few examples of this carnage,
			    there was very little sign of people coming to the Deep Creeks.</p>
			
		    
			<img src="DSC02053.jpg" alt="Deep Creeks Skiing" width="600" height="402" />
			<p>Here's the Bristle Cone Pine tree that inspired me to buy a wide angle lense.
			    It's in the mail, Yes!</p>
			
		    
			<img src="P1010041.jpg" alt="Deep Creeks Skiing" width="600" height="450" />
			<p>This is an interesting pict because Fu, the Princess, and the photographer
			    are oblivious to Morning Glory (in the distance, next to the
			    dog's right ear). Sweet Cheeks, however, is tuned into the fact that she's just had
			    a very unfortunate accident.</p>
			
		    
			<img src="P1010043.jpg" alt="Shoulder Dislocation in the Deep Creeks" width="600" height="434" />
			<p>After we re-located Morning Glory's shoulder, Nurse Princess applies
			  a sling and Sweet Cheeks gives a good luck head butt. Complete
			  details of the incident to come. To make a long decent story short, it
			  all ended well...</p>
			<p>I took a great picture of the Deep Creeks range as we pulled away from
			  our camp in Granite Canyon. I'd put the picture right here, but
			  it turns out that I never actually turned the camera on, so you'll
			  just have to ask me about it.</p>
