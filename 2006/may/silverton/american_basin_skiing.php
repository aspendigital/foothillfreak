            <h1>Skiing in American Basin, San Juan Mountains, Colorado  </h1>
            <h6>            Sunday, May 28th, 2006            </h6>
            <p>Lou Dawson calls American Basin one of his favorite areas to backcountry
              ski, and it's easy to see why. The second we began our hike I was
              experiencing exactly what I drove the 8+ hrs to experience: vast
              bowls, rows of assorted couloirs, incredible
              views, a 14er, and everything above treeline.</p>

            We're not in the Wasatch anymore, toto! </p>

            Snow in the steeper chutes was quite good, but the moment you'd enter
              the apron, deep horizontal runnels would pummel tired thighs and
            encourage back seat driving. </p>

            This is Mount Handies. Two from our group split off to ski it. You
            can see them descending in the middle of the picture... </p>

            <p>
            Our carpool might have had room for an extra six pack, but other
            than that, the rig was completely packed... </p>

            <p>
            Here's our camp as the temperatures plummeted to the low 20's F.
              The VW bus quickly became the place to be and be seen, tho finding
              a place to sit became the most challenging event of the weekend. </p>
