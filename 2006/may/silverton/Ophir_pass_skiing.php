            <h1>Skiing Near Ophir Pass, San Juan Mountains, Colorado  </h1>
            <h6>            Saturday, May 27th, 2006            </h6>
            <p>The report from a Silverton Forest Ranger was that the snowline
              was at 11,000 ft, the snow was severly suncupped, and it was going
              quickly. So imagine how shocked we were when we arrived at this
              backcountry skiing mecca and discovered that the snowline
              was at 11,000 ft, the snow was severly suncupped, and it was going
              quickly.</p>

            Strange to come all this way to look at the ground, oblivious
            to the panaramic view.</p>

            Short skis are light, quick turning, and capable of popping straight
              through the snowpack to the rocks below, which happened shortly
            after this picture... </p>

            <p>
            There were a couple guys on this trip that had loose heels on their
              skis, WHILE DESCENDING!!! I found this fascinating so I took a
            picture as proof. </p>

            More loose heel action, CRAZY! </p>
