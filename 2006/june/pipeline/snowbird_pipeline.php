            <h1>Climbing and Skiing Snowbirds Pipeline Couloir, Utah </h1>
            <h6>Saturday, June 3rd, 2006</h6>

            <p>After lusting over this line for 4 years, reading the route description
              in Chuting Gallery at least once a month for those 4 years, countless
              moments of staring at it on topo maps, dozens of ooglings from
              the top of Baldy, and multiple Google Earth fly bys, the time to
              ski the Pipeline came. We set our alarms for 3:30, were at the
              base of the bird at 5, the bottom of the chute at 7, and were skiing
              down around 8. The timing was perfect: corn that allowed smooth
              turns, but provided plenty of encouraging grip. </p>

            <p>
            Not a bad place to wake up. </p>

            I will confess, we skied from the top of the couloir, but we didn't
              get to ski from the summit. There was a small rock band that had
              developed, bifurcating the run about 25 feet from the top. Fu enjoys
              the view. </p>

            The spirit of the Foothill Freak was omnipresent in the couloir... </p>
