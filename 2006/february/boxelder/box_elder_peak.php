            <h1>February 25th, 2006</h1>
            <p>In search of new diggs for the sniffaz, and to
              avoid the wasangeles phenonomon, we got up a little earlier and
              headed to Alpine to check out the mountain that always seems to
              be off in the distance, never up close: Box Elder Peak. </p>

			 <p>Box Elder Peak on the approach, the super couliour bisects the
              cliff on the right. </p>

            <p>
Here's a close up of the north cirque. On the approach from Alpine/Dry Creek,
  you get plenty of time to scope your line.</p>

            Pleanty of chic power graced the tour. </p>

            <p>
            On the way up there was a beautiful line that featured the best surface
                hoar I'd seen all year. We had to take a run... </p>

            <p>
              We weren't sure if we'd be able to ski from &quot;Ze Summitt&quot; with all the exposed rock we were seeing from
                  a distance. But luckily, there was this thin, snowy traverse
                  right near the top that gave us good access. </p>

            Princess powers through the initial crusts, moving on to ski the best two lines of the day.</p>

              Last run of the day, some 3500 vft above our car at the trailhead.</p>

              Two new freakers that have yet to develope
                  proper freak nomenclature. The snow was so sticky on this run
                  that getting down was quite a chore. Princess
                  had the best run due to riding on freshly waxed boards. That's
                  my excuse and I'm standing by it. </p>

            <img src="DSC01514.jpg" width="600" height="450" />
			<p>We returned to the freakmobile, skiing all
                  the way to the parking lot. Mission
                  Accomplished. </p>
