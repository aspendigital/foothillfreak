            <h1>Skiing Mount Nebo </h1>
            <h6>Friday, May 25th, 2007</h6>
            <p>Memorial day was approaching fast. I wanted one last ski trip
              to finish off the season. Despite our poor snowpack in the Wasatch,
              there were still plenty of options. Shasta? Tahoe? Silverton? All
              sounded very inviting, but there were three problems: Skyrocketing
              gas prices, driving long distances, and ski buddies that
              were rapidly migrating to lesser sports, like lemmings off a cliff.</p>
            <p>This group dynamic  was enough to make even me question the validity
              of keeping skiing, and to ponder if my quest was truly
              the desperate, quixotic endeavor my friends insisted it was. But
              only for a second. </p>
            <p>Then Powder Princess came to the rescue. She could muster enough
              time off for at least a two day road trip. We decided on wednesday
              to leave thursday night for Great Basin National Park. </p>
            <p>Then
              the fourth problem surfaced: what to do with the powder porpoise?
              As dogs aren't allowed on national park trails we had to quickly
              find her a home. An hour before departure we came to terms with
              the fact. We couldn't find her a home so last minute on memorial
              day weekend. We had to change plans. The choice was easy: explore
              the most mysterious, impressive, least explored range in Utah,
              the Tushar Mountains.</p>
            <p>That was the plan. It was set. Ski the Tushars. We were happy.</p>
            <p>And then  we saw Mount Nebo.   </p>
            <p><img src="../3ranges/DSC03858.jpg" alt="Mount Nebo" width="600" height="443" /></p>
            <p>The summit of Mount Nebo has eluded me for 3 years
              and a handful of attempts. This trip was different: perfect weather,
              perfect cramponing conditions, perfect snow stability, pretty close
              to perfect corn.</p>
            <p> <img src="../3ranges/DSC03789.jpg" alt="ascending the left couloir of Mount Nebo" width="600" height="442" /></p>
            <p>Dr. Evil about a quarter of the way up the lookers left couloir.              </p>
            <p>There was one part of the trip that wasn't so perfect: the crux
              of our ascent. About 50 ft from the summit ridge, where the couloir
              was the steepest, the snow slowly decayed away into a thin crust
              of water ice over loose rock. I'll confess that for the first time
              in my life I was so determined on reaching the summit that I was
              able to completely ignore the obviously dire situation. I climbed
              without thinking, front pointing the ice until it turned into loose
              rock which turned into scree which turned into muck as the slope
              angle finally lessened and tired legs refused to front point any
              longer. I had made it! Now it was the Princess' turn. </p>
            <p>Anyone who's ever climbed with the princess knows that she loathes
              climbing on loose rock. As I didn't encounter a single secure point
              I knew she was in for a real thriller. Plus she had
              the added stress of having had to watch me awkwardly stab my way
              up the rotten detritus of a route first. </p>
            <p>I would have taken some
              pictures of this fine area, but honestly, I was totally gripped.
              The powder porpoise was quite gripped too. She kept wedging herself
              between my legs in a frightened state that seemed both affectionate
              and likely to send me toppling down the steep crack onto christine,
              who was already busy dodging flying shards. </p>

            <p>Back on snow again for the last few steps to the summit. On top,
              PP was quick to point out that there was no way we'd make it back
              down our ascent route. We were committed to finding a different
              way down. </p>
