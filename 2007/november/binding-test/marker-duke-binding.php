    <h2>Marker Duke Binding Review in 3 sentences:</h2>
    <p>Solid. Skiing the Duke made the wide Bro boards edge like a slalom ski,
      making an icy run way more fun than the previous bindings in this review.
      The walking motion
      was fluid, and traversing
      up an icy slope was just as solid as the ski down. I would put this binding
      on any ski that spends more than half of it's days inbounds, but since
      the ski must be removed  to switch modes from climbing to skiing, I would
      not use this binding on a dedicated backcountry setup.</p>
    <h2>More About the Marker Dukes</h2>
    <p>After a couple times of skiing the icy man-made snow down to the Alta
      base, I had grown weary of the icy spots. The Dukes are such a solid feeling
      binding, my confidence truly soared and I was able to enjoy turning on
      the ice, and to leave some deep ruts in the process. This binding truly
      shines in it's ability to lay wide boards on edge. It made me realize that
      I'd never need to by a non-touring resort binding again.</p>
    <p>Switch opereates easily with gloves on.</p>
    <p>fluid walking.</p>
    <p>Doesnt' really seem any heavier. (raw deal to be know as the heaviest)</p>
    <p>really easy to operate heel lifts.</p>
    <p>lift isn't enough. especially considering the DIN (bigger dins should
      have bigger climbers!)</p>
    <p>Huge DIN, way more than I need. I'd probably consider it too much except
      for the fact that these bindings rip!</p>
