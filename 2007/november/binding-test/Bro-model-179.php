    <h1>AT Binding Review</h1>
    <h2>One Ski to Review them All.</h2>
    <p><img src="DSC04256.jpg" alt="The Bro Model" width="500" height="667" /><br />
    The Bros and I spent 5 days together exploring Alta before it opened for
      the season.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I got lucky. A friend of a friend contacted me to help her with a Alpine
      Touring binding review. AND just so happens that she writes for my most
    favorite publication in the world: <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E0DF113DF933A15751C1A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink" target="_blank">The New York Times</a></p>
    <p>The rules were simple: I had to ski 5 different Alpine Touring bindings
      in the backcountry and report back so she could write the article. I also
      had to pick the ski that I wanted to use for the test. </p>
    <p>I wasn't planning on new skis this year. I felt a little out of the loop
      and needed to start some reasearch. Suddenly I found myself dreaming of
      waist and shovel dimentions, flexes and core materials, tip and tail heights,
      more than I usually do.</p>
    <p> I decided that to be fair to the range of bindings, I had to
      choose an all-conditions ski. I wanted to try the bindings out in the usual
      conditions I encounter in the bc: crusts, powders, corns and
      the variable conditions in-between. </p>
    <p><img src="DSC04273.jpg" alt="Bros in the workshop" width="600" height="450" /><br />
    The Bros have a bomber topsheet  and had no problems
      handling the many holes necessary for multiple binding mountings.</p>

    <p>100mm under foot seemed perfect. Fat
      enough to float way over tasty wind-board, but not so fat that an icy
      traverse would blow me away. Then I started reading about PM Gear's Bro
      Model 179... and it was perfect:</p>

    Powder Princess and the Bro's, ready to go. Now all we need is snow.</p>
