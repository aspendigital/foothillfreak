            <h6>September, 2007</h6>

            The east face of Volcan Llaima as we approached from the small pueblo
            of Cherquenco.</p>
            <p><img src="images/DSC00425.jpg" alt="grooms on lliama" width="600" height="463" /><br />
            We started our climb a couple hours before the resort opened, sleepily
            following the t-bar lift up.<p><img src="images/DSC04114.jpg" alt="Volcan Llaima in the morning" width="600" height="471" /></p>
            <p><img src="images/DSC04115.jpg" alt="Skiing across the plateau beneath Volcan Llaima" /><br />
            There was a middle plateau that felt like an endless sea of snow.
              A little hump on the ridge that seemed close by somehow got further
            and further away as we approached.</p>
            <p><img src="images/DSC00432.jpg" width="600" height="463" /><br />
            We came to ski the corn, but the last 300ft to the summit was mostly
            frosted flakes.</p>
            <p><img src="images/DSC04125.jpg" width="600" height="421" /></p>
            <p>High winds. Sulfer spewing caverns. Collapsing snowpacks. Crumbling
              steep slopes that fall away into a vertical chasm ending in a
              smoking molten pit... The Summit rim of Volcan Llaima was a downright
              unsetteling place. To view the steaming, precipitous depths of
              the crater gave me new respect for our living, breathing planet.
              I hate to use the word evil, but there was something stunningly
              ominous about this place. To fall into the crater here would be
              to literally crash and burn. In between blasts of wind thundering
              in our ears, La Choriza turned to me with an even
              bigger grin than normal and said, &quot;If there really is a Gates of
              Hell, this is what it looks like&quot;.</p>

              La Choriza about to decide that she's standing close enough to
                the edge.<br />
            </p>
            <p><img src="images/DSC04135.jpg" width="600" height="424" /><br />
            I'm not sure if there is a name for the huge, manky snow crumpets
              that spackled the top of the peak. You could probably ski them
            if you wanted to...</p>

            La Choriza eager to shred after summiting our first South American
              volcano. Here down we found some more corn-ish snow. But as it
              had just dumped the morning the day before, the snow wasn't quite
            ready yet...</p>
