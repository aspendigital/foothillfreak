            <p>Skiing at Las Araucarias Ski Resort reminded me of everything
              I love about skiing: the simple, mystical charm of being on a mountain
              in the sun in wintertime. People didn't care what they were wearing,
              they didn't care what kind of gear they had, they didn't even care
              if their car couldn't make the last 2 icy miles to the resort.
              People were outside, and they were happy.</p>
            <p>If you're skiing in Chile I'd higly recommend skipping a day at
              one of the bigger resorts to hang with the locals of <a href="http://www.skiaraucarias.cl/">El
              Centro de Ski Las Araucarias.</a></p>

              <br />This is about 3km away from Las Aruncarias Ski resort. We
              should have parked here and started walking, like the people on
              this bus did. We would have gotten to the slopes sooner than trying
              to drive...
