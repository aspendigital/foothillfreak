            <h1>Baldy Knoll Yurt Trip, Tetons</h1>
            <h6>February 23rd to the 26th, 2007</h6>
            <p>I first went to Baldy Knoll Yurt with Chloa, her boyfriend at
              the time Rob, and her parents in 1993. I can't remember much of
              the details of that trip other than being constantly amazed. I
              had leather boots, 200 cm Tele Savage skis, and the same backpack.</p>
            <p>14
              years later, I find myself skiing from the same yurt and finding
              just as much, if not more, amazement... </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03361.jpg" width="600" height="453" /></p>
            <p>If you awaken in the middle of the night to the sound of freshly
              fallen snow sliding off the canvas roof of the yurt, there'll be
              a powder fairy waiting outside to greet you... </p>

            The traverse from the yurt. </p>

            <p>Helmut makes funny swooshing noises with his mouth to accentuate
              the carving experience. </p>

            <p>Teton trees against the sky always look silvery to me,
              both in reality and my dreams. </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03406.jpg" width="600" height="414" /><br />
            We farmed one run just a little bit. The rest of our skiing was completely
            free range... </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03397.jpg" width="600" height="414" /></p>
            <p>We kinda broke Bruce Trempers 33 degree rule that ruled the Wasatch
              back home. </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03393.jpg" width="600" height="462" /></p>
            <p>This is the first time that the rare Teton Yeti was not only seen,
              but was captured on film. </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03418.jpg" width="600" height="419" /></p>
            <p>If you want to see the Teton Yeti, find a steep powdery slope
              and listen very intently. If you hear a sound similar to nylon
              material flapping behind a jet engine approaching, watch closely
              and you may get see him... </p>

            <p>At the bottom of one of many chutes that were very kind to us. </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03434.jpg" width="550" height="735" /></p>
            <p>We seriously got our moneys worth out of the skin track that we
              (Helm&uuml;t and DH-One) put in. The last move was to round a steep
              pillow, an event christend &quot;licking the nipple&quot;. </p>

            <p><img src="DSC03448.jpg" width="600" height="438" /></p>
            <p>Token &quot;I don't want to go back to reality, but I have to,
              but I think I'll just stand here, above it all, for one last moment,
              look around, soak it all in, and put off returning, just a
              few moments more&quot; shot.</p>

            <p>Teton Yurt Trip 2007: Another reminder of why we carry heavy loads,
              why we look to odd places to visit in treacherous weather, and
              why we keep skiing.  </p>
