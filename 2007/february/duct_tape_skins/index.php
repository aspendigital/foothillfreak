            <h1>Spruces to Millcreek</h1>
            <h6>February 4th, 2007</h6>
            <p class="caption">Because unpleasant situations make good practice for
              future unpleasent situations </p>
            <p>The plan was to ski from Spruces Campground in Big Cottonwood
              over and out Millcreek Canyon. The group was a friendly bunch
              of experienced backcountry skiers, most of whom I hadn't met before.
              I think I made a really good first impression when at the trail
              head I realized that I'd left my skins at home.</p>
            <p>It's been a while since I felt like such a noob. Luckily, the
              group was very understanding. It was obvious that the
              only beating my ego would take from this mishap would be self inflicted.
              It also became apparent that I had two choices: to hitch
              a ride back down the canyon while wallowing in self-pity, dreaming
              of  travels lost and powder un-plundered, or to just start walking
              and see how far I could get.</p>
            <p>Of course I chose the latter option. There's just no adventure
              in getting to the trailhead, realizing you've forgotten something,
              and going home. </p>
            <p>Knowing that there hasn't been any real new-snow accumulation
              in weeks, I figured that I could hike pretty far up the canyon,
              maybe even up to the deso trail fork. So I started off, maintaining
              a good clip on the completely supportable trail. I passed a couple
              avalanche classes. It looked like the prerequisite for one of the
              groups was to have a tiny plastic shovel and huge pants
              with the crotch at knee level. Maybe I need to take an avy class
              to find out what these new trends are all about?</p>
            <p>The trail was easy going, firm supportable, but I knew it was
              only a matter of time before I started sinking in, so I began a
              round of brainstorming. The first idea was to break some piney
              branches and strap them to my feet as a crude snow shoe. Then I
              thought of my skis built in flotation and ways to turn them into
              non-sliding devices. The deciding factor was when I realized that
              piney branch snowshoes wouldn't have the benefit of multi-level
              climbing posts. So here it is, the result of my learnings:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h1>What to do when you've forgotten your skins</h1>
            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <p>Find some dead branches that have a diameter
              a bit thicker than a pencil. I wanted something that would break
              easily into measured lengths, so I chose dead aspen branches, which
              become very brittle with age. I then broke the branches into lengths
              slightly shorter than the width of my skis. </p>
            <h2><img src="DSC03234.jpg" alt="duct tape" width="600" height="450" /></h2>
            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            <p>I keep a roll of duct tape on my poles a few inches below
              the handle. Mostly I keep it there because it makes an excellent
              lower grip that I use on long traverses. The second
              reason is for days like today.</p>
            <p>My first few experiments used the full width of the tape. Not
              only did it not work as well for making my anti-sliding devices
              but I noticed that I was going through the roll too quickly.
              The best solution was to use a half wide strip of tape. </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03237.jpg" alt="step 2" width="600" height="420" /></p>
            <h2>Step 3</h2>
            <p>I made  strips three times the width of the ski and placed my
              stick in the middle. </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03239.jpg" alt="step 3" width="600" height="421" /></p>
            <h2>Step 4</h2>
            <p>Then I took a much shorter piece and wrapped it around the stick
            to prevent it from getting knocked out. </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03244.jpg" alt="the finished product" width="550" height="733" /></p>
            <h2>Step 5</h2>
            <p>Finally, I positioned the sticks on the bottom of the ski and
              folded over the ends of the tape. I put 3 on each ski, 
              in the center third of the ski. The one beneath
              my foot and the one behind the binding seemed the most essential
              and the best spot to put a forth. </p>
            <h2>How it worked </h2>
            <p>With my MacGyver climbing grips I not only finished the bi-canyon
              traverse, but I climbed far enough up Reynolds Peak to get a good
              line down into Millcreek. I could climb on the steepest
              skin tracks as long as they were firm and even. Any sort of irregularity
              would take pressure off the climbing twigs and I'd go for the dreaded
              back-slide. If I broke my own trail, which I ended up doing in
              order to maintain sanity, I could  climb about as steep as a kick-wax
              setup would allow. </p>
            <p>Overall, it was much more fun to figure out how to make them than
              it was to use them. They advanced easily, but forget about
              glide. On each climbing step, the ski slipped back just a tiny
              bit. Nothing much, but infuriating to someone used to the instantly
              secure grip of quality fur. I also came to realize that skins have
              decent lateral grip, as a sloping skin track would send this set-up
              skidding off to the side. It was a
              good reminder of the few wretched days I toured on Voile Snake
              skins waaaay back in the day. Let's just say I have a new appreciation
              for skins, and on my next tour, I'm not likely to forget them.</p>
