            <h6>February 17th to 19th, 2007</h6>
              <p>Here are some shots
          from a President Day weekend trip to the Shrine Mountain Lodges in
              the Vail Pass area. We were very fortunate to have a sunny break
                in stormy weather, good companions, and deep snow, perfect for
                making snow angels. </p>

            <p>Skiiing on sunday it was very easy to think of calling it a
              day early in order to hang out in the warm sun, right here... </p>

            <p>The first night we broke trail through heavy and
              deep upside-down snow up to the top of Shrine Mountain. The view
              was quite worth it. So much to ski... </p>

            <p>It's impossible to walk by sustrugi like this and not want to
              take a picture. </p>

              faces at the photographer... </p>

            <p>The long traverse on the back side of Shrine Mountain. There was
              plenty of woomphing to keep you entertained and wondering if maybe
              the 20 degree slope could indeed slide? </p>
