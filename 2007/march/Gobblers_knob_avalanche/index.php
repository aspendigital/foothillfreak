            <h1>Gobblers Knob Avalanche</h1>
            <h6>March 14th, 2007</h6>
            <p>Gone, gone, gone... All
              the white stuff of my favorite lines on Gobblers Knob ended up
              in a massive debris pile a half mile down canyon by the intersection
              of North Raymond Fork and the Gobblers gully. Touring in the Raymond/Gobblers
              neighborhood today was like tip toeing through a dragon's lair;
              carnage lay heaped around every corner. The avalanche on cabin
              run looked tiny next to this monster. Nature never ceases to amaze. </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03521.jpg" /></p>
            <p>Kinda hard to see before the sun came up.</p>
            <p><img src="DSC03522.jpg" /></p>
            <p>The standard skin track route was about the only part that didn't
              slide. </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03528.jpg" alt="Gobblers Knob avalanche" width="600" height="450" /></p>
            <p>This is the middle part of the slide, or the beginning of the
              deposition zone which stretched about a quarter mile. If we get
              a dump big enough to bury the huge chunks, it'll be really great
              skiing! </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03531.jpg" /></p>
            <p>Here's the lower middle part of the slide, more of the deposition
              zone. Thousands of aspen scrubbies thankfully flattened. </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03535.jpg" alt="Skiing up to the Gobblers Knob Avalanche" width="600" height="450" /></p>
            <p>Supportable crusts made for excellent explorations. </p>
            <p>
              <img src="DSC03539.jpg" /></p>
            <p>This is looking down the track towards the intersection with North
              Raymond fork. No more crashing through the brush! </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03540.jpg" alt="Gobblers Knob Avalanche" width="600" height="466" /></p>
            <p>This is looking back up the track towards Gobblers Knob. </p>
            <p><img src="DSC03534.jpg" alt="Another Gobblers Knob Avalanche" width="600" height="441" /></p>
            <p>This was a smaller slide between Gobblers and Raymond. It's a
              stunning example of how trees don't always work as anchors.</p>
            <p><img src="DSC03525.jpg" alt="Skinning on Raymond Shoulder" width="600" height="447" /></p>
            <p>We stuck to low angles, ridges, 
              supportable crusts and slopes that had already slid as we tip-toed
              through the dragon's lair... Till noon, anyways. </p></td>
