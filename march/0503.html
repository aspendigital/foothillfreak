              <span class="maincont">My man Powstash skied this line last week
              with Trackhead and it's been pretty much all I could think of since
            I heard about it Thanks guys for the inspiration!</span></p>
            <p><span class="maincont"> To allow for
                maximum sleepage, we slept the night before in Helmut's van at
                the put in. What we didn't
  know then, but know now, is not to try to sleep there. The dry canyon trail
  head parking lot is  a thriving late night hotspot for &quot;star gazers&quot; and for
                throwing used condoms out the window.</span></p>            
            <p class="maincont">In the darkness of 5 am we hit the trail. Then,
              at about 5:30 we realized that we weren't on the trail at all,
              but were bushwacking
              through dry canyon creek. The proper trail was high above us to
              the north. Once we regained the proper route our thoughts turned
              towards when
              we
              would reach the snow line so we could lighten our packs. Unfortunately
              we had to gain just under 2000 vtf before
              we could
              strap
              on
              the boards. From there it was challenging skinning and the occasional
              cramponing directly up our descent route.</p>

              <span class="maincont">Beautimus line to return to and ski next
              year. We watched someone ski the line alone. His loudly icy sounding
              turns weren't comforting.</span></p>

              <span class="maincont">Here's the really scary line we skied and
              a huge orange arrow. The skiing from the top would have been good
              corn if we waited about 2 hours till 1:00. We waited
              about 5 minutes, got bored and
                skied the ice. Probably a good thing as the corn below was just
            perfect.</span></p>

              <span class="maincont">Dude, it was, like, so steep! It was like
            80 degrees! Here's proof!</span></p>

              <span class="maincont">The real crux of the skiing came down low
              on a terminally ill snow vein. There were intermittent gap jumps
            and really pointy sticks.</span></p>

              <span class="maincont">Helmut experimented with riding across a
              steep mud embankment. Suprisingly, his skies stopped dead in the
              dirt and he launched into the best cartwheel down a rocky slope
              I've seen since mountainbiking season. If only I had the camera
            out!</span></p>

              <span class="maincont">Good thing about 2+ weeks of no new snow
              is that it entices you to go new places. That's how we ended up
            on days end.</span> I <span class="maincont">don't know what it's really called, but it's
            pretty much the last big avy drainage on the right as your skiing

              <span class="caption">Bonkers</span><br />
              <span class="maincont">It's been two weeks since a decent snowfall,
              but today the freak and his team managed to ski one of the best
              runs of the year. Bonkers. When you first lay eyes on it you can
              hear the clashing of symbols and the yodeling of angels, just like
              in the movies. Then you start going up. Then you keep going up.
              And continue going up. You reach a saddle and get the amazing view
              straight down stairs gultch to Big Cottonwood road 5000 feet or
              something below you. Then you continue going up. When you reach
              the top you look down the run and think really big and happy thoughs,
              like &quot;wow!&quot; for example. If you're lucky, the steeper
            top 600 feet are covered in deep, soft, feathery surface hoar crystals. </span></p>

              The approach was our first taste of the icy, slippery skin tracks
              of spring this season. Our nerves fried from the unexpected slips
            that would wake us from the otherwise calm climb.</span></p>

                but we skied Scott's bowl anyway. Despite the fact that it looked
                like Alta after a powder day, there were still some soft lines
                left. This avalanch path is apparently now on everyone's radar
            as bushwacking is no longer mandatory.</span></p></td>
