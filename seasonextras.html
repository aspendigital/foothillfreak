            <span class="caption">Cloud Chasing on Mt. Wire</span><br />
            5 AM I got the call. Powder Princess was blowing chunks to the proceline
            throne. Without a backup buddy to ski with I decided to go back
            to sleep. But my thighs kept me awake. They wanted to climb. They
            didn't care if it was dark and rainy out. They wanted to pound out
            some vert. So my legs dragged me out of bed and up to Red Butte,
            where they took me up my favorite trail that goes straight from the
            car
            to the top of Mt. Wire. The smell of wet sage was a welcome scent,
            overpowering the stale wafts of smog and ozone. Climbing the cold,
            wet rungs of the radio tower to the top provided a 360 view of nothing
            but
            fog. Rain chased me back down to the valley.</p>

              <span class="caption">Sniffer Ski At Deer Valley, Empire Area</span><br />
              Suprisingly, we weren't the only totally desparate skiers out there
              who had decided to brave the early summer like heat. Star Child
              was thrilled
              to
              finally get in some quality powder porpoiseing. Deer Valley is an
              excellent
              spot for
              early
              season
              sniffer-skiing
              as dogs are welcome and some
              steep, N facing
              lines are right in front of the parking lot. Watch out
            for brown snow and bring some sun screen.</p>

              <span class="caption">Chute schopping: Wolverine cirque and Tuscarora</span><br />
              We hiked up Grizzely Gulch, following the ridge along Patsy Marley,
                The Cirque, up to Wolverine peak, with our heads glued to our
              left shoulders, looking for the perfect chute. The Sickel seemed
              long and tasty so
              we hit that for
                starters. After another  line in the cirque, we worked
              our way over towards Tuscarora were we skied a north facing chute,
                then crossed
                over a notch onto the east face, which was sun crusted to perfection.
            We finished with a setting sun home run from 10,595 (Point Supreme?).</p>          <p class="maincont"><br />

              Foothill shreds Baldy Main Chute, Helmutt practices good skiing safety

          <p class="maincont"><span class="location">November 4</span><br />
              <span class="caption">Baldy Main Chute</span><br />
              Deciding to ski main chute was easy as looking down
              little chute was a real sphincter tightner. The low snowpack accentuated
               the teeth of this run, and the crux was narrow and long enough
            to ensure more side slipping than I care to practice before breakfast.</p>
          <p class="maincont"> Main Chute was soft and powdery, allowing smooth,
            round turns. Tombstone at the bottom was as good as ever. The real
                danger of the day was when we
                 tucked the semi-groomed run back to base. I forgot to pre-jump
                 a big rollover near the new mid-station and caught more air
            than recommended when going 30mph+ over a still frozen, hacked groom
            job
            on ultra-light
            rando gear. </p>          
          <p class="maincont">It wasn't a total
               yardsale. After I had finally come to a stop, one ski had
            somehow managed to stay on. I had skidded so hard that when I 
            stood up
            my pants
            had
            
            been twisted
            around
            backwards! I was still laughing about it when I made it to work an
            hour later.</p>
          <p class="maincont">Baldy Chutes are always an excellent choice for
            an early morning flushing.</p>

              <span class="caption">Scott's Bowl</span><br />
  If you're ever thinking of skiing Scott's bowl this early in the season, I've
  got a bit of advice for you: DON'T GO! If you do go, I've got some more advice:
  you're probably bigger, stronger,
  and
  smarter than those sticks at the bottom of the run so lean back, keep your tips
  up,
  and
  for
  god's
  sake,
  don't have any crash landings on  punjabis. Beautiful place to watch the sunrise
  and to contemplate wether the noise that radiates from Little Cottonwood Canyon
   comes from wind, water, or traffic.</p>

              <span class="caption">Fred's Trees, Alta</span><br />
              Snow as good as any of the best days of January. Being the first
              to ski under the still unfinished new chairlift without a single
              track to be seen in any direction is quite exhillaring. Face shots
              and that freezing neck sensation
              for those of us who forgot to bring mufflers was the rule. Snow
              base totals at Collins
              Gultch reached
            80 inches. I repeat, 80 inches of base in October!!!!</p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="location">October 30</span><span class="caption"><br />

            Felt good to crank some mileage on this second weekend of the season.
            While skiing the empty runs of Solitude we could look over to see
            the crowds of Brighton, the first resort to open this season. (Opened
            October 26th).</p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="location">October 26</span><br />
            <span class="caption">South face of West Bowl of Silverfork</span><br />
Had to go back for more trailbreaking on this south face. New wind events had
reshaped the terrain into ribs and fins, and turned the light powder into stiffly
whipped cream. </p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="location">October 24</span><br />
              <span class="caption">South face of West Bowl of Silverfork</span><br />
&quot;Why not break trail straight up to Jaws rather than go up Flagstaff and
traverse over&quot;, we asked.<br />
&quot;Because it takes over 2 hours when the breaking is deep&quot;, was the
mountain's reply.<br />
  Suprisingly deep, light snow and a cloudy history of no sun exposure made the
  south flanks an actual ski destination. We aborted plans to ski the north facing
  slopes to enjoy the longer, steeper lines in exceptionally good form.</p>          <p><span class="location">October 23</span><br />
            <span class="caption">Days Fork</span><br />
            <span class="maincont">Winter arrived early. Fluffy yet firm powder
            up to 3.5 ft in depth was enough to forefit the need for rock skis
            or snowboards. Cornice dropping was fun until
Helmutt heard his knee go &quot;pop&quot; when he fell into a crack behind a
partially dropped block. Warmish temps combined with falling snow had people
loosing their skins right and left. Unless, or course, they were using BD asencions.</span> <span class="maincont">Not
bad for an early season shake down. </span><br />
