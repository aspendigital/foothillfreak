            <p>The south
              west chutes off the false summit of Mt. Adams hold an even 35-40
              degrees for over 3500 ft. Coming from the Wasatch where there are
              only a handful of consistent runs over 2000, this felt like an
              eternity. From the top, the flats below looked gray and fuzzy,
            like some far off horizon.</p>            
            <p>It was risky, but I played &quot;scissors&quot; and
              won the game of rock-scissors-paper to be the first to ski. However,
              I didn't make it far past the first slight rollover. In my excited
              state of skiing nirvana I had completely lost my breath. Powder
              Princess held it together best on the massive line and gracefully
              carved the longest run in
              one
              shot, about 2500 vft. At the bottom she was  bubbling
              over with self astonishment.We were all bubbling over with astonishment!<br />
              <br />
              We camped two nights on the ridge next to Crescent glacier at about
              7800 <br />
              ft. This was an excellent spot to stage our climbs as well as to
              finish our days. There was a steep south facing bowl
              just to the west of our camp that made for convenient afternoon
            skiing, and a great way to end the day.</p>
            <p> I can get into this volcano thing. Next year we all agreed to
              ski the volcanoes of the north west for at least a week. Unfortunately
          there's a whole season of powder skiing to get through first before
              we can head back to this gliss paradise.</p>
