            The avy report says &quot;storm totals from Tuesday night to 3 to 5&#8217; in
              the Cottonwoods&quot;, but there was little over a foot of new snow
              from that period in the Porter Fork area. We skied up the bowman
              fork
              trail, took some runs in the cabin shot area, dug a snow pit on
            belay, summited, and skied a long line down into gobblers through
            challenging wind
              drifts and powdery debris that had our quads screaming by the end.
            We hit the car at dark, 6:00. <span class="icct">ICCT: 2 hand hits

              Well, a year ago helmut and I started off down this chute, but
              turned back once helmut came upon a short cliff band. Today, the
              powder
              princess and I returned with rope and harness, to complete the
              voyage. Unfortunately, for lack of
              a doggie
              specific
              harness, Star Child had to stay at home. Since  my picts turned
              out so bad, I decided to give them that &quot;yellowish,
              crappy
            old photo&quot; look. Enjoy!</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="december/images/raymond3.jpg" width="600" height="433" /><br />
            The chute is slightly left of center of this pict that I took a couple
              weeks earlier from Main Porter. In the picture it goes straight
            down from the center of east Raymond ridge.</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="december/images/raymond2.jpg" width="600" height="600" /><br />
            Here's the powder princess at the bottom of the rappel. I would have
              shown the picture of her rappelling over the lip, but that shot
              makes the cliff look like it's only about a 10 foot drop, which
              it probably
            is...</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="december/images/raymond1.jpg" width="600" height="478" /><br />
            This is looking back up after making a few turns down the apron.
            It looks kinda small in this photo but it's really HUGE!</p>
          <p class="maincont">Norte &amp; Shorte, or whatever it's called, makes
            an exciting home run after sessioning Raymond's North Glades.
            The upper half of the run offers some great turns with that &quot;over
            a  cliff&quot;
            feel.
            The
            bottom
            apron rolls
            out pretty
            quickly,
            but it's fun to ski the north drainage, which roller coasters down
            through wide fields of mysteriously short &amp; stubby pines. The chute
            fills
            in by the end of the season, and is also down climbable
            or
            jumpable
            for
            those
            inclined
              to steep freakishness. My  plan is to return in a few months once
            it fills in and ski it top to bottom, with a stop in the middle
            to pull the ring and runners I've left behind. If you beat me to
            it,
            they're
            on
            skiers left, help yourself.</p>

            It was bitter cold and the snow was completely windblown, but at
            least there was a nice, long approach.

              I don't know who named this run, but I don't think they did a very
              good job of it. Star Child and I were quite pleased to discover deep,
            soft powder on our one and only Christmas day run.</p>

              Great skiing down in the trees, and we were in radio contact
                with another friend as he summited the Pheiferhorn above us,
                making
                us quite jealous. We discovered a ramshackel shelter on the ridge
                and helped ourselves to a Christmas Eve shot of the Crown Royal
                that
            was stashed there!</p>

              Days Fork was shit, but from the top of Toledo Bowl to LCC road was
              Da Shit! Phenonemal corn snow blanketed the south faces. With the
              sun low, temps low, and the winds constant, the south side offered
            firm, but carveable corn even for our home run at 3:45.</p>

              <span class="caption">Gobblers Knob</span><br />
              Big tour day for Star Child as we climbed from Porter Fork to
                the top of Gobblers. Almost every surface had slid, creating
                a snowpack
                that was about two feet shallower than when we were there two
                weeks ago. The massive funneling of the debris convieniently
                cleared
                a swatch through the wiene wackers, giving the north face a least
                200
                vft more open skiing. The screaming professor tested out his
                new rando gear and for the first time was able to keep up with
                leaping
            ScruffBucket.</p>
            <p class="maincont">On another note, SomeGuy had a party. There was
                a brainstorming session in which a new tag line for the foothill

              We dawn patrolled our way up to Georges to get a birds eye view
                of the avalanche that fatally trapped two snowshoers in Mineral
                Fork.
                On our way up, we were blown away by the sight of a recent slide
                that seemingly came out of nowhere, took out the approach trail
              (cardiff fork road), hit the valley bottom and shot up the opposite
              side
                of the
                drainage, knocking over most of an aspen glade on it's way. Definitely
                a slide to ruin your day, and a reminder why the snowshoers,
              most likely never stood a chance. The snow up on Georges
                was very fun, carveable powder, The icy road out was a good reminder
                of why I wear a helmut. The remains of several massive avalanches
                were good reminders of why the dangers of this sport should not
            be underestimated.</p>

                Big Daddy was in town so an Alta day was called for. By the
                  last run, He had charmed and amassed a large posse of hot,
                  shredding
                    telemarking babes. This meant that if Big Daddy fell into
                  a tree well, there
                    would be a crew of darling young women to pull him out. Therefore,
            I took off  to hit some steep lines...</p>

              We had a Phat possee. With it being a high avy day, I opted
                    for the security of the Mill D area. We entertained ourselves
                    with
                    ultra
            low angle snow and tight tree runs.</p>

              Pretty much just went up Porter Fork to look across the range
                      and see our tracks on Gobblers from the day before. Every
                      work of beauty
                      deserves to be admired. (unfortunately, our turns did not
                      survive the next snowstorm. The weight of the new snow
              took out the
                      layer upon which we skied. The marks of our passing ended
                      up in a large
            debris pile, 1500 feet below where they were left....)</p>

              What could possibly be better than eating turkey after a full day
              of skiing? Why, it's skiing the day after thanksgiving with a backpack
              full of turkey leftovers!
  To Share the love, we brought Star Child with us to one last tour at Deer Valet
  before the resort opens next weekend. There was about 8 inches of new snow
              on top
  of
  a mysterious and often crusty base that was constantly challenging your fore &amp; aft
  center of balance. Looked good, felt like shit. I always think of Deer Valley
  as a warm haven, but suprisingly cold temps kept us moving. The stellar
  leftovers had to wait for the drive home...</p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="location">November 25</span><br />
              <span class="caption">Turkey Day Tour</span><br />
  Sure, the Thanksgiving day feast was going to be at the freak Bachealor Pad,
  but that's no reason to stay home cooking all day. We simply divied out cooking
  responsibilities and found someone to watch the turkey for us. When it comes
  to skiing, at times you must delegate! Despite rather low moral and less than
  inspiring conditions, we managed to put in a couple laps in Maybird, and make
  it back to the pad in time to eat ourselves into a coma.</p>

  Lucky for us, there were still some untracked lines in Days fork. It's been almost
  three weeks since significant precipitation, yet we found some absolutely scrumptous
  powder. Even more proof that ski resorts should just be avoided entirely....</p>          <p class="maincont"><span class="location">November

    <span class="caption">Cloud Chasing on Mt. Wire</span><br />
5 AM I got the call. Powder Princess was blowing chunks to the proceline throne.
Without a backup buddy to ski with I decided to go back to sleep. But my thighs
kept me awake. They wanted to climb. They didn't care if it was dark and rainy
out. They wanted to pound out some vert. So my legs dragged me out of bed and
up to Red Butte, where they took me up my favorite trail that goes straight from
the car to the top of Mt. Wire. The smell of wet sage was a welcome scent, overpowering
the stale wafts of smog and ozone. Climbing the cold, wet rungs of the radio
tower to the top provided a 360 view of nothing but fog. Rain chased me back
down to the valley.</p>

        <span class="caption">Sniffer Ski At Deer Valley, Empire Area</span><br />
  Suprisingly, we weren't the only totally desparate skiers out there who had decided
  to brave the early summer like heat. Star Child was thrilled to finally get in
  some quality powder porpoiseing. Deer Valley is an excellent spot for early season
  sniffer-skiing as dogs are welcome and some steep, N facing lines are right in
  front of the parking lot. Watch out for brown snow and bring some sun screen.</p>

We hiked up Grizzely Gulch, following the ridge along Patsy Marley, The Cirque,
up to Wolverine peak, with our heads glued to our left shoulders, looking for
the perfect chute. The Sickel seemed long and tasty so we hit that for starters.
After another line in the cirque, we worked our way over towards Tuscarora were
we skied a north facing chute, then crossed over a notch onto the east face,
which was sun crusted to perfection. We finished with a setting sun home run
from 10,595 (Point Supreme?).</p>

              Deciding to ski main chute was easy as looking down
              little chute was a real sphincter tightner. The low snowpack accentuated
               the teeth of this run, and the crux was narrow and long enough
            to ensure more side slipping than I care to practice before breakfast.</p>
          <p class="maincont"> Main Chute was soft and powdery, allowing smooth,
            round turns. Tombstone at the bottom was as good as ever. The real
                danger of the day was when we
                 tucked the semi-groomed run back to base. I forgot to pre-jump
                 a big rollover near the new mid-station and caught more air
            than recommended when going 30mph+ over a still frozen, hacked groom
            job
            on ultra-light
            rando gear. </p>          
          <p class="maincont">It wasn't a total
               yardsale. After I had finally come to a stop, one ski had
            somehow managed to stay on. I had skidded so hard that when I 
            stood up
            my pants
            had
            
            been twisted
            around
            backwards! I was still laughing about it when I made it to work an
            hour later.</p>

            an early morning flushing.</p>

              <span class="caption">Scott's Bowl</span><br />
  If you're ever thinking of skiing Scott's bowl this early in the season, I've
  got a bit of advice for you: DON'T GO! If you do go, I've got some more advice:
  you're probably bigger, stronger,
  and
  smarter than those sticks at the bottom of the run so lean back, keep your tips
  up,
  and
  for
  god's
  sake,
  don't have any crash landings on  punjabis. Beautiful place to watch the sunrise
  and to contemplate wether the noise that radiates from Little Cottonwood Canyon
   comes from wind, water, or traffic.</p>

              Snow as good as any of the best days of January. Being the first
              to ski under the still unfinished new chairlift without a single
              track to be seen in any direction is quite exhillaring. Face shots
              and that freezing neck sensation
              for those of us who forgot to bring mufflers was the rule. Snow
              base totals at Collins
              Gultch reached
            80 inches. I repeat, 80 inches of base in October!!!!</p>

              the crowds of Brighton, the first resort to open this season. (Opened
            October 26th).</p>

Had to go back for more trailbreaking on this south face. New wind events had
reshaped the terrain into ribs and fins, and turned the light powder into stiffly
whipped cream. </p>

&quot;Why not break trail straight up to Jaws rather than go up Flagstaff and
traverse over&quot;, we asked.<br />
&quot;Because it takes over 2 hours when the breaking is deep&quot;, was the
mountain's reply.<br />
  Suprisingly deep, light snow and a cloudy history of no sun exposure made the
  south flanks an actual ski destination. We aborted plans to ski the north facing
  slopes to enjoy the longer, steeper lines in exceptionally good form.</p>          <p><span class="location">October 23</span><br />

            <span class="maincont">Winter arrived early. Fluffy yet firm powder
            up to 3.5 ft in depth was enough to forefit the need for rock skis
            or snowboards. Cornice dropping was fun until
Helmutt heard his knee go &quot;pop&quot; when he fell into a crack behind a
partially dropped block. Warmish temps combined with falling snow had people
loosing their skins right and left. Unless, or course, they were using BD asencions.</span> <span class="maincont">Not
bad for an early season shake down. </span><br />
