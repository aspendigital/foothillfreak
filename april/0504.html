            </span><span class="maincont">Finally got a posse together to explore
            thaynes Canyon and the infamous ski out directly to the Mill Creek
            Inn. A ridge ascent that goes on forever, horrible breakable crusts
            combined with indecipherable visibility and a ski out finish on paper
            thin snow were some of
            the highlights,
            along with skiing somewhere completely new that we never got to see.
So bad I can't wait to go back.     </span></p>

              <span class="maincont">Finally, the south side corned up and was
                  ready to rip. Powder Princess was excited to try out her new birthday
                  crampons on some  early morning
                    ice, but by the time everyone was picked up and errands were
                  done, the snow was soft enough that we didn't really need them.
                  The middle apron was so strewn with ice nuggets that it felt more
                  like sumo wrestling than skiing, but the bottom apron had some
            great, smooth corn for the tasting.</span></p>
