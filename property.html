          <p class="caption">As the famous Native American Indian saying goes, &quot;Who
            can own a mountain? Let's shred!&quot;</p>
          <p class="maincont">True freaks respect those who own the private property
            which barricades access to and from the Salt Lake Cities foothills.
            High elevation home owners should be respected for their superior
            work ethic which means that they deserve to live there. If some freaks
            loose out on access and some wildlife have a harder time putting
            food on the table, it's okay because these folks worked for it. </p>
          <p class="maincont">Think also of their contributions to our society.
            These transitional area obstruction owners are responsible for completing
            such tasks as: inserting balls into loops, protecting our environment
            by having nuclear waste shipped to our valley, or by cashing in on
            developing more of the foothills into affordable housing for their
            affluent business partners. </p>
          <p class="maincont">I also appreciate the fences they put up to keep
            the moose, deer, elk, and foothill freaks away from their tasty ornamental
            shrubs. Nothing makes a concrete statement of ownership like a chain
            link fence. These Markers of arbitrary boundary are needed to keep
            beasts in their &quot;natural habitat&quot;, where the food supply
            can be buried under feet of snow for months throughout a typical
            Utah foothill winter.</p>
          <p class="maincont"> I am also respectful of the need for  food,
            shelter and dry underwear. Obvious lines
            of ownership should not prevent you from meeting these needs at the
            end of the day. So if after a long tour in the foothills you discover
            your way to the Red Iguana Mexican
            Restaurant is blocked by someones backyard,
            use your
            best judgment.            </p>
          <p class="maincont">If
              you do decide to trespass, just be sure to hold the gate open for
            any moose wanting to migrate to warmer, tastier climes with you.
            Also, remember
            that
            by
              unwritten law, cold, hungry, and lost foothill skiers have the
            right to go ahead and ring the doorbell of these more fortunate,
            high altitude home owners
              and ask to use the phone, borrow a fiver, and get a ride to the
            local pub. </p>
          <p class="maincont">In summary, respect no trespassing signs (what
            ever that means...) Also respect the area between no trespassing
            signs, which obviously is
            an area that is open to trespassing since there isn't a sign. And
            in case you are not greeted with open arms while trespassing, be
            sure to have a power bar and book on skiing handy for any paddy wagon
            detours
            or
            trips
          to the slammer.</p></td>
