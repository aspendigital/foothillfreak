          <h1> The World's Most Essential  Glossary of Skiing terms + Ski
            Slang</h1>
            <span class="caption">Want to talk the talk while walking the skin
              path walk? The Freak's own  complete guide of backcountry ski and snowboard
              terminology is here to help.</span></h1>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="subhead">Avy Bait: </span><em>noun.</em> Person
            with new BC equipment and no skillz. Seen in abundance
            on the first dump day after Christmas. Phenonomen particulary common
            among fringe winter sports enthusiasts including, but not limited
            to, extreme snow tubers (a special class of avy bait in themselves).
            Best avoided. </p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="subhead">Corn Snow:</span> <em>noun</em>.
            Springtime snow condition in which the snowpack surface identically
            resembles the yellow rows and kernels of corn on the cob. Extra good
            corn conditions are likely to resemble the &quot;salt and pepper&quot; corn
            variety, though some prefer &quot;indian corn cob&quot; snow conditions.
            Hominey is another excellent corn sub-class, but Polenta is best
            avoided. Don't try eating corn snow though as it tastes like
            brussel sprouts.</p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="subhead">De-veining:</span> <em>verb</em>.
            To loose control while riding a narrow patch of snow and spin off
            into the rocks, grass, or native fauna. See veining.</p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="subhead">Freakin:</span> <em>verb.</em> To
            hike, climb, ski, rappel or generally flail about with skis or snowboards
            on low elevation hills with the main intent of finding snow and/or
            angled surfaces upon which to slide back down upon.</p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="subhead">Fruit Booters:</span> noun.
            (Skateboardese dialect, Durango region, 2000 A.D.) Rollerbladers.
            On snow, this term is applicable to mini-ski skiers. </p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="subhead">Half-a-lapper:</span> <em>noun.</em> One
            who starts their descent from a lower elevation (hence a lesser position)
            than the proper top of the skin track or summit. A despicable creature
            known to &quot;poach&quot; your line while you're up ahead breaking trail.
            If you are tempted to adopt &quot;half-a-lapper&quot; behaviors,
            remember the wise words of world famous ski guide Szen Shushler, &quot;Vee
            Ske from Ze Summit, and Ze Summmit is Ze Top!&quot;. </p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="subhead">Hoar
            Frost:</span> <em>noun.</em> The perfect eyeshadow
            for an 80's themed get together.</p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="subhead"><a name="gaper" id="gaper"></a>Gaper:</span> <em>noun.</em> First
            documented use in Aspen, CO, 1986. A person on the slope who spends
            a lot of time looking, often stopping in annoying, inappropriate,
            or downright dangerous places to do so. Refers to the dropped
            jaw status of the onlooker. Worthy of praise as they keep
            ski resorts in business by actually buying lift tickets and lunch
            in the cafeteria. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="subhead">Gaper Block:</span> <em>noun.</em> A congregation
            of gapers clogging
            access to inappropriate or downright dangerous lines.<br />
            <br />
            <span class="subhead">Gaper Gap:</span> <em>noun.</em> The exposed
            space on the forehead found between the top of one's ski goggles
            and the front of one's hat or helmet. Note: distance and total area
            of said gaper gap are generally proportional to an individual's relative
            gaper status. </p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="subhead">Groomer</span>: <em>noun.</em>            A
            destructive variety of <a href="#gaper">gaper</a>. A skier or rider in a tight
            chute who &quot;grooms&quot; fresh
            powder snow by sideslipping the complete width of an entire chute.
            Also known as the &ldquo;snow squeegee&rdquo; or
             making boarduroy. (gaper and groomer derogatory terminology taken
            and edited without permission from <a href="http://departments.cvuhs.org/justinc/teleclub/ski_slangs.htm">http://departments.cvuhs.org/justinc/teleclub/ski_slangs.htm</a>,

            a telemark skier drops so low that they hold their pole handles up
            by their head. The effect is heightened when the poles are thrust
            out horizontally to the sides, thus creating the siloette of a fully
            racked moose plowing through the snow. Often used in combination
            with double pole plants and a large <a href="#Poodlefactor">poodle
            factor</a>.</p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="subhead">No Fall Zone:</span> <em>noun.</em> Slope
            angle description that implies huge ragdoll potential followed by
            certain and painful  death. Frequently comes into use when
            members of the opposite sex are present, especially near &quot;Bettys&quot;. </p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="subhead"><a name="Poodlefactor" id="Poodlefactor"></a>Poodle factor:</span> <em>noun.</em>            The
            amount of fore and aft distance between the feet of a telemarker
            during a dropped knee turn. A large poodle factor is often found
            among beginner (or gaper) telemarkers. See Also Moose Antlers.
            I'm not making this shit up! </p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="subhead">Punjabi sticks:</span> <em>noun</em>.

            positions. See also &quot;Moose Horns&quot;. </p>

            board that you should throw away or turn into furniture, but keep
            riding instead. Like a rock ski, but far worse. Usually features
            multiple binding mounting holes, blown edges, missing patches of
            p-tex, rotting wood and exposed fiberglass. Excellent for thin snowpacks
            and for making a statement on the tram. </p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="subhead">Ski Boardz: <em></em></span><em>noun</em>. A snowboard
