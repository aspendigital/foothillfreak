          <p class="caption">&quot;Who can own a mountain? Let's shred!&quot; ~Famous
            Native American saying.</p>
          <p>True freaks respect those who own the private property which barricades
            access to and from the Salt Lake Cities foothills. High elevation
            home owners should be respected for their superior work ethic which
            means that they deserve to live there. If some freaks loose out on
            access and some wildlife have a harder time putting food on the table,
            it's okay because these folks worked for it. </p>
          <p>Think also of their contributions to our society. These transitional
            area obstruction owners are responsible for completing such tasks
            as: inserting balls into loops, protecting our environment by having
            nuclear waste shipped to our valley, or by cashing in on developing
            more of the foothills into affordable housing for their affluent
            business partners. </p>
          <p>Foothill freaks also appreciate the fences they put up to keep the
            moose, deer, elk, and foothill freaks away from their tasty ornamental
            shrubbery and landscaping. Nothing makes a concrete statement of
            ownership like a fence of some sort, the uglier, the better. These
            arbitrary boundary markers are needed to keep beasts in their &quot;natural
            habitat&quot;, where the food supply can be buried under feet of
            snow for months throughout a good Utah winter in the foothills.</p>
          <p> Foothill freaks are also respectful of the need for food, shelter
            and dry underwear. Obvious lines of ownership should not prevent
            you from meeting these needs at the end of the day after skiing in
            the foothills. So if after an especially long tour you discover your
            way to the Red Iguana Mexican Restaurant is blocked by someones backyard,
            use your best judgment.</p>
          <p>If you do decide to trespass, just be sure to hold the gate open
            for any moose wanting to migrate to warmer, tastier climes with you.
            Also, remember that by unwritten law, cold, hungry, and lost foothill
            skiers have the right to go ahead and ring the doorbell of these
            more fortunate, high altitude home owners and ask to use the phone,
            borrow a fiver, and get a ride to the local pub. </p>
          <p>In summary, respect no trespassing signs (what ever that means...)
            Also respect the area between no trespassing signs, which obviously
            is an area that is open to trespassing since there isn't a sign.
            And in case you are not greeted with open arms while trespassing,
            be sure to have a power bar and book on skiing handy for any paddy
            wagon detours or trips to the slammer.</p>          <p class="contheader">&nbsp;</p>
