		    <h2>The board of choice</h2>
		    <p>
		      When it comes to extreme-ly
              low elevation riding, the true freaker must be adaptable. Where
              traversing
              and
              rolling
              terrain is concerned, free heels are the way to go. Free heels
              also come in handy for crossing streets and parking lots for those
              who are determinded to &quot;ski all the way&quot; back to the
            car. </p>
		    <p>For steep, rotten and unpredictable snow, which
              are pretty much the best conditions you can ask for in the foothills,
              locked
              heels are best. Locked heels decrease your odds of face-plants
            on rock strewn, shallow snowpacks. Toting alpine touring gear around
              the  foothills also let's bystanders know that you mean business.</p>
            <p>For Xxxtra-extreme-ly low snowpacks,
              ski-boards (aka &quot;snowboards&quot;)
              float high and turn easily on 10cm of snow, as well as sandstone,
              quartsite, and dense shrubbery. While &quot;riding&quot; the snowboard,
              it's okay to &quot;cop a 'tude&quot;. Additionally, If you're faced
              with snowboarding down a long, completely wind
              scoured
              and
              snowless
              ridge, you can always feel good about the fact that at least you're
          not ruining a perfectly good pair of skis.</p>
            <p>Whatever you choose to ride, be sure it's vintage.
              Nothing makes a clearer statement than raging on some skis found
              in a dumpster or won from a hot dog eating contest.</p>            
            <h2><span class="location">Additional Essentials</span></h2>
            <p>Impact
                rated goggles are a must to prevent eyeball Shish Kabob. Primarily
                worn on the way down, they also come in handy for asending particularly
              nasty patches of scrubbies. If you can't find them in a quality
              ski shop, check Home Depo.</p>
            <p>Steel ski poles are heavier than their
              aluminum cousins, but they stay straighter longer and are far more
              satisfying when wacking through deep brush. With steel poles you
              can easily knock off dead branches and create a direct and tidy
              line through the wilds. Upon descending, use them to faithfully
              deflect potential &quot;weenie whackers&quot; or punjabi sticks. Leave the
              carbon fiber at home!</p>
            <p>Maps are pretty usless in the field as they tend
          to confuse and cause dissention among the ranks. However, keep a good
              map at home. That way when you do finally find your way home from
              the wilderness you can prove  to yourself that
              you knew where you were  all along.</p>
