            <p>In December 2001, Bud Smithson
                came out of deep, 5 year coma that resulted from a tragic nail-gun
                accident. He came
              back to this world with a burning mission: to ski in some of the
              most overlooked places right outside of cosmopolitan Salt Lake
              City. Fearless of shrubbery and vast expanses of snowlessness, &quot;the
              freak&quot; was reborn that winter, bushwhacking up, down, and
              across the foothills. </p>
            <p> That winter, while others stayed home, complaining
              about the lack of snow in the wasatch, the freak found an unprecedented
              stash of powder at lower elevations. Also know as crud, mush, ice,
              sustrugi, confetti, dirt and asphalt, the freak found all these
              wonderful snow conditions within minutes from his job as a deep
              fat fryer technician near Trolley Square.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the past few
                years have not been so good for &quot;freakin'&quot;. Low elevation
                snow totals have been nonexistent, and global warming threatens
                the very future of this
              new sport: Extreme-ly Low Elevation Skiing. But until the big dumps
              come low, you may still follow the freak's adventures as he rigorously
              trains in the upper, middle, and lowest wasatch.</p>
