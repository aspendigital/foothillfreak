              Well, a year ago helmut and I started off down this chute, but
              turned back once helmut came upon a short cliff band. Today, the
              powder
              princess and I returned with rope and harness, to complete the
              voyage. Unfortunately, for lack of
              a doggie
              specific
              harness, Star Child had to stay at home. Since  my picts turned
              out so bad, I decided to give them that &quot;yellowish,
              crappy
            old photo&quot; look. Enjoy!</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/raymond3.jpg" width="600" height="433" /><br />
            The chute is slightly left of center of this pict that I took a couple
              weeks earlier from Main Porter. In the picture it goes straight
            down from the center of east Raymond ridge.</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/raymond2.jpg" width="600" height="600" /><br />
            Here's the powder princess at the bottom of the rappel. I would have
              shown the picture of her rappelling over the lip, but that shot
              makes the cliff look like it's only about a 10 foot drop, which
              it probably
            is...</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/raymond1.jpg" width="600" height="478" /><br />
            This is looking back up after making a few turns down the apron.
            It looks kinda small in this photo but it's really HUGE!</p>
          <p class="maincont">Norte &amp; Shorte, or whatever it's called, makes
            an exciting home run after sessioning Raymond's North Glades.
            The upper half of the run offers some great turns with that &quot;over
            a  cliff&quot;
            feel.
            The
            bottom
            apron rolls
            out pretty
            quickly,
            but it's fun to ski the north drainage, which roller coasters down
            through wide fields of mysteriously short &amp; stubby pines. The chute
            fills
            in by the end of the season, and is also down climbable
            or
            jumpable
            for
            those
            inclined
              to steep freakishness. My  plan is to return in a few months once
            it fills in and ski it top to bottom, with a stop in the middle
            to pull the ring and runners I've left behind. If you beat me to
            it,
            they're
            on
            skiers left, help yourself.</p>

            <span class="caption">Georges Bowl, again.</span><br />
            It was bitter cold and the snow was completely windblown, but at
            least there was a nice, long approach.

              I don't know who named this run, but I don't think they did a very
              good job of it. Star Child and I were quite pleased to discover deep,
            soft powder on our one and only Christmas day run.</p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="location">December 24</span><br />
              <span class="caption">Maybird Trees</span><br />
              Great skiing down in the trees, and we were in radio contact
                with another friend as he summited the Pheiferhorn above us,
                making
                us quite jealous. We discovered a ramshackel shelter on the ridge
                and helped ourselves to a Christmas Eve shot of the Crown Royal
                that
            was stashed there!</p>
          <p class="maincont"><span class="location">December 19</span><br />
              <span class="caption">Days fork, Toledo bowl</span><br />
              Days Fork was shit, but from the top of Toledo Bowl to LCC road was
              Da Shit! Phenonemal corn snow blanketed the south faces. With the
              sun low, temps low, and the winds constant, the south side offered
            firm, but carveable corn even for our home run at 3:45.</p>
            <p class="maincont"><span class="location">December 18</span><br />
              <span class="caption">Gobblers Knob</span><br />
              Big tour day for Star Child as we climbed from Porter Fork to
                the top of Gobblers. Almost every surface had slid, creating
                a snowpack
                that was about two feet shallower than when we were there two
                weeks ago. The massive funneling of the debris convieniently
                cleared
                a swatch through the wiene wackers, giving the north face a least
                200
                vft more open skiing. The screaming professor tested out his
                new rando gear and for the first time was able to keep up with
                leaping
            ScruffBucket.</p>
            <p class="maincont">On another note, SomeGuy had a party. There was
                a brainstorming session in which a new tag line for the foothill
                freak was born: <span class="caption">www.foothillfreak.com:
                  It's Fer Reals, Brah.</span> Also at the party the utah classic
                  bumpersticker &quot;I love mormon pussy&quot; mysterious appeared on
                  SomeGuys vehicle....</p>

                <span class="caption">Georges Bowl</span><br />
              We dawn patrolled our way up to Georges to get a birds eye view
                of the avalanche that fatally trapped two snowshoers in Mineral
                Fork.
                On our way up, we were blown away by the sight of a recent slide
                that seemingly came out of nowhere, took out the approach trail
              (cardiff fork road), hit the valley bottom and shot up the opposite
              side
                of the
                drainage, knocking over most of an aspen glade on it's way. Definitely
                a slide to ruin your day, and a reminder why the snowshoers,
              most likely never stood a chance. The snow up on Georges
                was very fun, carveable powder, The icy road out was a good reminder
                of why I wear a helmut. The remains of several massive avalanches
                were good reminders of why the dangers of this sport should not
            be underestimated.</p>

                <span class="caption">Alta Day</span><br />
                Big Daddy was in town so an Alta day was called for. By the
                  last run, He had charmed and amassed a large posse of hot,
                  shredding
                    telemarking babes. This meant that if Big Daddy fell into
                  a tree well, there
                    would be a crew of darling young women to pull him out. Therefore,
            I took off  to hit some steep lines...</p>

                      <span class="caption">Mill D, Reynolds north trees, Big
                      Water area</span><br />
              We had a Phat possee. With it being a high avy day, I opted
                    for the security of the Mill D area. We entertained ourselves
                    with
                    ultra
            low angle snow and tight tree runs.</p>
          <p class="maincont"> <span class="location">December 5</span><br />
              <span class="caption">Main Porter Fork</span><br />
              Pretty much just went up Porter Fork to look across the range
                      and see our tracks on Gobblers from the day before. Every
                      work of beauty
                      deserves to be admired. (unfortunately, our turns did not
                      survive the next snowstorm. The weight of the new snow
              took out the
                      layer upon which we skied. The marks of our passing ended
                      up in a large
                      debris pile, 1500 feet below where they were left....)<br />
