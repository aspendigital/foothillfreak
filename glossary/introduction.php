            <p>On  the massive cornice, my friend pointed excitedly. &quot;Look.
              There's a pinhead!&quot;</p>
            <p>Pinhead? I'd never heard of a pin head before. And judging by
              this character before me, I had definitely never seen one before
              either. He was tall and lean, with a neat ponytail down to the
              small of his back, his chin buried behind a  thick beard. Snow
              shedding red fabric was wrapped around the tops of his little leather
              boots up to his knees, and his thighs were coated in duct tape.
              His tattered goretex jacket looked around 10 years old, despite
              the fact that it was 1990 and goretex ski jackets had just been
              invented. </p>
            <p>Suddenly, he pointed his long wobbly skis down the ridge and was
              off. Upon reaching top speed, he arched a smooth turn. He dropped
              his inside knee all the way to the ski, leaned his weight forward,
              and launched off the cornice, heartily soaring into the thin winter
            air. </p>
            <p>I had no idea a human could survive such air time, much less subject
              themselves to it on purpose. And his incredibly skinny skis flapping
              about on the ends of his toes didn't look very helpful. I was pretty
              sure he had no intention of actually landing the jump, but while
              in the air he maintained excellent form . At the end of his 40
              foot free fall, he completely cratered. </p>
            <p>Rebounding quickly, beard white with snow, both arms shot up
              into the air and a triumphant &quot;woooo hooooooo&quot; bellowed
              forth. He promptly dug out a pole, righted his goggles, put a stray
              ski back on, and was off again. He descended the rest of the bowl
              while feverishly dropping a knee in each round turn. Then the first
              telemark skier I'd ever seen promptly dissappeared, leaving nothing
              but a trail of spindrift and a large legacy in his wake. </p>
            <p>&quot;So that's what a pinhead is.&quot; I thought.  &quot;I like
              pinheads!&quot;</p>
            <p>15 years later, I'm still learning new words that
              help explain this incredible sport of sliding on snow. Growing
              waves of newcomers, snow sliding super stars and ancient powder
              stash die-hards continue to add to this colorful language. Escalating
              feats of human endeavor as well as technological advances also
              fuel the need for new terms. And sitting on a chairlift for 9 minutes
              as well as hiking up a skin trail for hours continues to be
              the perfect incubator for creating new ways of talking about riding.</p>
            <p>New technologies have helped snow sliders push the boundaries.
              The internet has become an incredible asset to the skiing community,
              allowing up to the minute trip reports, mountain cams, and even
              snow data that's free of resort marketing influence. This form
              of conversation also allows creative jargon to go from local slope
              to national awareness within seconds. Nothing is sacred in a conversation
              between snow riders, but creative story telling and lexicon usage
              can garner as much respect as impressive feats of riding. </p>
            <p>But for every new voice that arrives to carry on the  oral tradition
              of gliss, an old voice fades away. One evening, I discover an
              internet chat thread discussing the term &quot;pinhead&quot;.
              The group's dialog starts off with someone asking what one is.
              Others join in, having no idea what the term means or where it
              comes from. Eventually someone explains how in days of old, tele
              bindings had pins that inserted into the toe of the boots, which
              were then clamped to the ski. Another in the forum reminisced about
              the skinny skis and the leather boots. Another the beard and the
              brown bag lunch. Slowly, from collective conscience, the fabled
              pinhead is recreated and the newbie gets the picture. </p>
            <p>This is why the Freaktionary is
              here: to attempt to preserve this wonderfully diverse
              language. A dialectical time capsule, <em>The
              Freaks' Mostly Accurate Ski Glossary</em> is here to keep important
              terms like &quot;gaper gap &quot;, &quot;poodle factor&quot;, and
              &quot;the arlberg technique&quot; alive and in circulation. It's also somewhat
              educational with origins and additional fascinating facts documented
              whenever possible.</p>
            <p>Some of these words may be new to you. Others may be so ingrained
              that they seem like common knowledge. Read it, enjoy it, and use
              it to color some fables of your own.</p>
