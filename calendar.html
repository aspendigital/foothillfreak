              For purely scientific purposes, the freak
              has decided to maintain a ski log. To see what's happening and
              to see whos
            laid tracks where, follow these links to months of freakin action.</p>
            <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="maincont"><span class="Header">2004/2005 Ski Season</span><br />
              Bad year for snow down on the
              low down. Voodoo for snow below 7000 ft didn't work. But the upper
              peaks received
              epic porportions of powder all season long, providing one of the
            most consistently skiable seasons in remembered history.</p>
            <p class="maincont">Winter arrived in earnest with an 80 inch base
              at Collins by the end of October. Team freak made it's first trip
              to Canada, an event that is likely to become an annual event. One
              of the team freak members was even featured on a national news
              report on the hazards of avalanches.</p>
            <p class="maincont">As of writing in July, this is certainly looking
              like the year to ski year round. There should definitely be snow
              in gunsite or Baldy main come August. September remains to be seen...</p>
            <p>&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="maincont"><span class="Header">2003/2004 Ski Season</span><br />
              It was a good winter for the
              foothills. A huge, low elevation dump over the christmas holiday
              wiped out powerlines
              and choked snow blowers throughout Salt Lake City. Shoveling and
              sliding on snow became a way of life for the entire city for 48
              hrs straight. Then the winter stayed cold, and the sun rarely came
              out from behind a protective film of clouds. Low elevation lines
              stayed snowy for most of the season, enabling freaks to link turns
              on rare wasatch gems like Antelope Island, Grandure Peak into Parleys,
            and E Street in the Aves.</p>
            <p class="maincont">Powder and snowpack depths were preserved well into
              spring. Ridiculously safe avalanche conditions allowed many to
              push the envelope onto steeper terrain. Moguls formed in the Y
              Couloir, a whole new school of twin tippers entered the backcountry,
              yet there were no skier avalanche fatalities. Unless, of course,
              you count the snowboarders.</p>
            <p class="maincont">However, spring in the Wasatch came way to hot and
              fast. Late March, April and May were ususually warm, preventing
              proper corn from corning and skiers from skiing. A freak storm
              in the end of May brought incredible powder, and a small crowd
              of diehards converged on the upper bowls of Alta. Then in June,
              July, and August, the snowpack just completely went to shit. </p>
            <p class="maincont">The rest, my fiends, is history.</p>
