            <h1>Antelope Island Recon </h1>
            <h6>March 7th, 2004</h6>
            <p>              I came with my snowboard and snowshoes, but upon
              arrival I quickly realized that exploring Antelope Island and it's
              summit, Frary Peak is definitely a job for skis. The north side
              of the range didn't offer the skiing I'd hoped for, but the bizarre
              scenery, the gazing across the sparkeling lake, and the surreal
              isolation of the island makes it a ski destination not to be missed.</p>

            <p>Antelope Island, the holy grail of foothill freakin. </p>
            <p><img src="P1010019.jpg" alt="ski slope on Antelope Island" width="600" height="434" /></p>
            <p>This is probably one of the best slopes on the north side of the
              ridge. </p>
            <p><img src="P1010020.jpg" alt="Sastrugi on Antelope Island" width="600" height="450" /></p>
            <p>Sastrugi formed by  salty winds from across the lake. </p>
            <p><img src="P1010024panorama_sm.jpg" alt="panarama from near Frary Peak" width="600" height="337" /></p>
            <p>This little rib that extends into the lake on the west side of
              the island had me dreaming of skiing steep powder chutes down to
              my sailboat, resting at the dock. Caviar anyone?? </p>
            <p><img src="P1010025.jpg" alt="Frary Peak Summit Photo" width="600" height="450" /></p>
            <p><img src="P1010027.jpg" alt="descending Frary Peak on the north ridge" width="600" height="450" /></p>
            <p><img src="P1010031.jpg" alt="Antelope Island north slopes" width="600" height="450" /></p>
            <p>This is looking south, from the north tip of the island to the
              north faces of the range. Buffalo included for scale.  </p>
            <h2>Before your ski attempt of Antelope Island</h2>
            <p>A couple things to know about the island before you go: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>No dogs.</li>
              <li>You have to stay on trail. How your supposed to do this
                when the trail is under a couple feet of snow is moot. </li>
              <li>The park closes early, so don't plan on watching the sunset
                from on top, like I've always wanted to... </li>
              </ol>            
            <p>Alas, the holy grail is rarely perfect. </p>
