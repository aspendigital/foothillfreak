              Snow as good as any of the best days of January. Being the first
              to ski under the still unfinished new chairlift without a single
              track to be seen in any direction is quite exhillaring. Face shots
              and that freezing neck sensation
              for those of us who forgot to bring mufflers was the rule. Snow
              base totals at Collins
              Gultch reached
            80 inches. I repeat, 80 inches of base in October!!!!</p>

              Felt good to crank some mileage on this second weekend of the season.
              While skiing the empty runs of Solitude we could look over to see
              the crowds of Brighton, the first resort to open this season. (Opened
            October 26th).</p>

Had to go back for more trailbreaking on this south face. New wind events had
reshaped the terrain into ribs and fins, and turned the light powder into stiffly
whipped cream. </p>

              <span class="caption">South face of West Bowl of Silverfork</span><br />
&quot;Why not break trail straight up to Jaws rather than go up Flagstaff and
traverse over&quot;, we asked.<br />
&quot;Because it takes over 2 hours when the breaking is deep&quot;, was the
mountain's reply.<br />
  Suprisingly deep, light snow and a cloudy history of no sun exposure made the
  south flanks an actual ski destination. We aborted plans to ski the north facing
  slopes to enjoy the longer, steeper lines in exceptionally good form.</p>          <p><span class="location">October 23</span><br />

            <span>Winter arrived early. Fluffy yet firm powder
            up to 3.5 ft in depth was enough to forefit the need for rock skis
            or snowboards. Cornice dropping was fun until
Helmutt heard his knee go &quot;pop&quot; when he fell into a crack behind a
partially dropped block. Warmish temps combined with falling snow had people
loosing their skins right and left. Unless, or course, they were using BD asencions.</span> <span>Not
bad for an early season shake down. </span><br />
