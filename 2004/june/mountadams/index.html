                <td width="85%" valign="top"><p>The south west chutes off the false summit of Mt. Adams
                      hold an even 35-40 degrees for over 3500 ft. Coming from
                      the Wasatch where there are only a handful of consistent
                      runs over 2000, this felt like an eternity. From the top,
                      the flats below looked gray and fuzzy, like some far off
                      horizon.</p>
                    <p>It was risky, but I played &quot;scissors&quot; and won
                      the game of rock-scissors-paper to be the first to ski.
                      However, I didn't make it far past the first slight rollover.
                      In my excited state of skiing nirvana I had completely
                      lost my breath. Powder Princess held it together best on
                      the massive line and gracefully carved the longest run
                      in one shot, about 2500 vft. At the bottom she was bubbling
                      over with self astonishment.We were all bubbling over with
                      astonishment!<br />
                      <br />
        We camped two nights on the ridge next to Crescent glacier at about 7800 <br />
        ft. This was an excellent spot to stage our climbs as well as to finish
        our days. There was a steep south facing bowl just to the west of our
        camp that made for convenient afternoon skiing, and a great way to end
        the day.</p>

                  powder skiing to get through first before we can head back

                      <span>One of the many custom mountain
                      fashions sported by locals on Adams. We saw garbage bags,
                      modified sleeping pads, and even full body rubber suits
                      being used to facilitate flying down the mountain sitting
                      on your ass. It looked like so much fun that I questioned
                      why I was carting around such heavy equipment when I could
                      have just carried a plastic bag. There's always next year
                      to take up butt glissading...</span></p>

                      from the top was probably the the most exciting thing I've
