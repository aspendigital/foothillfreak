    <td bgcolor="#516472"><p>It started off like any ordinary mountainbike ride.
        At the trailhead, Helmutt and I covertly packed our backpacks with break
        down saws, pruners, and any other &quot;trail maintenance&quot; equipment
        that would fit. We were on a secret mission, with plans for a mostly
        trailless canyon that I had discovered on a run the week before.</p>
      <p>Big
        Plans.</p>
      <p>We hopped on the bikes and headed up  canyon.
            Our four legged
            friends StarChild and ScruffBucket bounced
        and barked with excited anticipation.</p>
      <p>Helmutt and the dogs got ahead
            from the start. I turned it down a notch, conserving my energies
            for sawing logs rather than spinning gears. I was enjoying the air,
            surprisingly
            cooler than the heat of the valley not that far away. I was enjoying
        a relaxed bike ride after a long day at work.</p>
      <p>I guess I was enjoying
          pedaling too, because eventually I started to catch up to Helmutt and
        the pooper patrol. StarChild came running back, snorted
              a greeting,
              and dropped in behind me. ScruffBucket was still galloping up
        ahead. Then I saw Helmutt starting off up a distant climb. I suddenly
        felt
              the need
              to crank it up and close the gap. The trail flattened out. I up
        shifted and started to really step on it.</p>
      <p>StarChild wasn't content with
          my progress. I saw her move out from behind me to pass on the right.
          She made a break for it off
                the side
                of the narrow
                trail, shooting through the tall grass with her head lowered
        like she does whenever she's in full sprint. </p>
      <p>She meant business. </p>
      <p>Then
                we were
                side by
                side, hurtling down the trail at top speed. Suddenly, there was
        a loud crack. StarChild was abruptly stopped as I sped ahead. She immediately
        broke out into a prolonged
                series
                of blood
                curdling yips, cries that burned into my memory. I slammed my
                breaks into a sudden stop of my own, dropped the bike and ran
        back up the trail. That's when
                I noticed
                a log, lying by the side of the trail, that had been hidden in
        the tall grasses. A log that was over 14 feet long and which tapered
        down
        to a
        smaller,
        javelin
        sized
        point. </p>
      <p>I don't like seeing blood. It makes me want to look away. And now I
        was looking at the most horrible thing I'd ever seen. But due to the
        urgency of the situation, I could not look away. StarChild was impaled
        on the end of the log. It went in her
        thigh above her knee,
        punched through the inside of her leg, and protruded out by her
        calf, still partially covered in skin. The wound was raw with
                  torn flesh, Her whole leg  twisted into an
        impossible angle. She was stuck on the end.</p>            
      <p>She looked
                at me, imploring, her left ear bright red with fresh blood. She
                wanted this stick
                out of her leg, pronto. I was about to pull her leg free when
        I remembered some
                ancient first aid training: leave impaled objects in place to
                minimize bleeding
        and infection. Then I remembered our saws.</p>
      <p>I called out to Helmutt, &quot;Help,
                help!&quot; He somehow heard my
                call and spun around.<br>
          I threw down my pack in a nervous thud, and rifled through for
                the saw. But StarChild wasn't so patient. She had yanked herself
                off
                the pointy end  and was standing there, relieved. She seemed
          to be ignoring the fact that the
          skin of her thigh was split almost
          all the
                way around
                her leg
                and was drooping down, leaving the inside of her thigh and knee
        completely skinless and exposed.</p>
      <p>Amazingly, the huge wound was mostly bloodless.
            Her fate seemed better now, but we still felt an urgent
        need to get her out of the woods and sewn up. We
                  gathered our
                  belongings
        and started  back. </p>
      <p>Could StarChild walk? She fired off a series of solid, defiant steps
        towards the car, then
                      suddenly stopped. She stood there like a statue, unmoving,
        and gave me another one of her looks. A look that
                      said: I really want out of here but I ain't going to make
          it on my own 4 feet so please don't leave me here carry me if you have
                      to
                      because
                      I'm
                      still cute aren't I look I'm still wagging my tail don't
        leave me here and could you tell ScruffBucket to back off?</p>
      <p>So we carried her. Very valiantly at first. 60 lbs can feel
      feather weight when you're saving a little furry universe. But over
        time you start to feel every bit of the burden. Helmutt and I took turns
        carrying her. Turns that started off long, then became exponentially
        shorter as our biceps became blown from carrying the wounded cargo. Near
        the end, we were doing
      shifts that were probably less than a minute long, but we made it, and
      StarChild seemed quite pleased to be not walking. We carried her over a
        mile.</p>
      <p>We dropped  Scruffbucket off at the bachelor pad, then b-lined
      for the emergency pet hospital. Our vet had seen Starchild before for a
        glass cut, but this time he was far more concerned about the damage done.
        He pointed
        out that she could have very easily severed her femoral artery, or had
        run
        the spear
      into her upper chest, both of which would have likely been fatal.</p>
      <p>He also went over what her surgery would entail, and the likely results.
      He had to go over the worst case scenario with us, saying the one word
        I really didn't want to hear: &quot;amputation&quot;. But her true outlook
        was better than that. A lot of stitches inside and out, a few weeks taking
        it easy and maybe she'd even recover full range of motion in her leg.</p>
      <p> Then He gave us
          the worst news of all, &quot;she's going to have to say
          the
        night in the hospital.&quot; I really didn't want to leave her. She just
        hates to be left behind... Or is it that I just hate leaving her behind.
        I
        was planning on looking over the vet's shoulder as he sewed her back
        up.
        Maybe give some constructive guidance, you know, make sure that the vet
      was doing it  right. I was planning on holding StarChild's paw so that
        I'd feel better. But we were sent home instead, leaving StarChild tranquilized,
        in a stainless steel cage to await her surgery.</p>
      <p>By the
            morning the news had settled and we were all feeling better about
        it. We picked her up promptly, anxious to be with our wounded little
        furball. At the hospital there was a happy reunion. She wagged her tail
        and even strutted a
        bit before quickly settling back down into a wounded daze. I lifted her,
        carefully placed her in the car and took her home.</p>
      <p>She's been getting better ever
          since.</p></td>
