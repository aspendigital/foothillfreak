              <span class="caption">Leftover Turkey Day Tour</span><br />
              What could possibly be better than eating turkey after a full day
              of skiing? Why, it's skiing the day after thanksgiving with a backpack
              full of turkey leftovers!
  To Share the love, we brought Star Child with us to one last tour at Deer Valet
  before the resort opens next weekend. There was about 8 inches of new snow
              on top
  of
  a mysterious and often crusty base that was constantly challenging your fore &amp; aft
  center of balance. Looked good, felt like shit. I always think of Deer Valley
  as a warm haven, but suprisingly cold temps kept us moving. The stellar
  leftovers had to wait for the drive home...</p>

              <span class="caption">Turkey Day Tour</span><br />
  Sure, the Thanksgiving day feast was going to be at the freak Bachealor Pad,
  but that's no reason to stay home cooking all day. We simply divied out cooking
  responsibilities and found someone to watch the turkey for us. When it comes
  to skiing, at times you must delegate! Despite rather low moral and less than
  inspiring conditions, we managed to put in a couple laps in Maybird, and make
  it back to the pad in time to eat ourselves into a coma.</p>

              <span class="caption">Days Fork Snowboarding</span><br />
  Lucky for us, there were still some untracked lines in Days fork. It's been almost
  three weeks since significant precipitation, yet we found some absolutely scrumptous
  powder. Even more proof that ski resorts should just be avoided entirely....</p>          <p><span class="location">November

    <span class="caption">Cloud Chasing on Mt. Wire</span><br />
5 AM I got the call. Powder Princess was blowing chunks to the proceline throne.
Without a backup buddy to ski with I decided to go back to sleep. But my thighs
kept me awake. They wanted to climb. They didn't care if it was dark and rainy
out. They wanted to pound out some vert. So my legs dragged me out of bed and
up to Red Butte, where they took me up my favorite trail that goes straight from
the car to the top of Mt. Wire. The smell of wet sage was a welcome scent, overpowering
the stale wafts of smog and ozone. Climbing the cold, wet rungs of the radio
tower to the top provided a 360 view of nothing but fog. Rain chased me back
down to the valley.</p>

        <span class="caption">Sniffer Ski At Deer Valley, Empire Area</span><br />
  Suprisingly, we weren't the only totally desparate skiers out there who had decided
  to brave the early summer like heat. Star Child was thrilled to finally get in
  some quality powder porpoiseing. Deer Valley is an excellent spot for early season
  sniffer-skiing as dogs are welcome and some steep, N facing lines are right in
  front of the parking lot. Watch out for brown snow and bring some sun screen.</p>

            <span class="caption">Chute schopping: Wolverine cirque and Tuscarora</span><br />
We hiked up Grizzely Gulch, following the ridge along Patsy Marley, The Cirque,
up to Wolverine peak, with our heads glued to our left shoulders, looking for
the perfect chute. The Sickel seemed long and tasty so we hit that for starters.
After another line in the cirque, we worked our way over towards Tuscarora were
we skied a north facing chute, then crossed over a notch onto the east face,
which was sun crusted to perfection. We finished with a setting sun home run
from 10,595 (Point Supreme?).</p>

              <span class="caption">Baldy Main Chute</span><br />
              Deciding to ski main
              chute was easy as looking down little chute was a real sphincter
              tightner. The low snowpack accentuated
               the teeth of this run, and the crux was narrow and long enough
            to ensure more side slipping than I care to practice before breakfast.</p>
          <p> Main Chute was soft and powdery, allowing smooth,
            round turns. Tombstone at the bottom was as good as ever. The real
                danger of the day was when we
                 tucked the semi-groomed run back to base. I forgot to pre-jump
                 a big rollover near the new mid-station and caught more air
            than recommended when going 30mph+ over a still frozen, hacked groom
            job
            on ultra-light
            rando gear. </p>          
          <p>It wasn't a total
               yardsale. After I had finally come to a stop, one ski had
            somehow managed to stay on. I had skidded so hard that when I 
            stood up
            my pants
            had
            
            been twisted
            around
            backwards! I was still laughing about it when I made it to work an
            hour later.</p>
          <p>Baldy Chutes are always an excellent choice for
            an early morning flushing.</p>

              <span class="caption">Scott's Bowl</span><br />
  If you're ever thinking of skiing Scott's bowl this early in the season, I've
  got a bit of advice for you: DON'T GO! If you do go, I've got some more advice:
  you're probably bigger, stronger,
  and
  smarter than those sticks at the bottom of the run so lean back, keep your tips
  up,
  and
  for
  god's
  sake,
  don't have any crash landings on  punjabis. Beautiful place to watch the sunrise
  and to contemplate wether the noise that radiates from Little Cottonwood Canyon
   comes from wind, water, or traffic.</p>
