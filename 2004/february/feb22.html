                  <p>Since I'm experienced with spending hours looking for runaway
                    skis, I was anxious to chase it down. But the line which
                    moments ago seemed like a treat now looked menacing. After
                    flailing down the best part of the run and learning that
                    I'm a horrible one legged powder skier, I found the ski hiding
                    behind a tree. It had caught some air and landed like a spear
                    in the snowpack. I recovered the runaway beast and triumphantly
                    mounted it to my previously crippled feeling foot.</p>
                  <p>The middle
                      part of our descent, which I usually consider to be the
                    crux of the run as it involves the most bushwacking
                      and potential to get lost, was
      good skiing and quite uneventful.</p></td>

            <p>Near the bottom, we sped down the porter fork road passing waves
            of pained looking backcountry travellers. A good distance from the
            trailhead Slim stopped to pick up a pile of doggie poop that he
            had bagged earlier on our way up. Gingerly riding with the bulging
            sack off to his side, he picked up speed and resumed his hurtling
            pace down hard packed trail. I gave the poop wide berth and let Slim
            take up the lead.</p>            <p>Once we reached peak speed, Slim's huge split board
              balked at the firm snow. He went down hard. I'm not sure if he
              cartwheeled or just
            slid but his tumble definitely went the distance because there was
            a long brown streak of dog shit that went on for twenty feet or so.
            I did my best to avoid the colorful stripes and splattered clumps
            while keeping an eye on the sky for any nuggets that might still
            be airborn. At the terminus of the rubble, Slim lay on the ground,
            frantically checking his body, not for broken parts, but for brown
            smears and smudges while saying, &quot;Euwe! euwe! euwe!&quot; </p>
            <p>I
              thankfully noted that he was not shit-faced, but was still concerned
              about giving a stinky, poopie coated passenger a
              ride home in the
              freak-mobile. Luckily, we discovered that he had escaped the carnage
              mostly unscathed, and had a hearty laugh before continuing down,
              now with a half full bag of shit.</p>
            <p>They say lightning never strikes
                the same place twice. That's why I could hardly believe my eyes
                when once again Slim's board seemed
                to just grab an edge and throw him off the trail onto the ground,
                dangerously close to a patch of trees and flowing creek. I swerved
                to avoid the new, slightly shorter but not less impressive brown
                streak and to help inspect for defiled body parts. Then we had
                good laugh at the fact that a dreaded fecal smearing had once
              again been
                luckily avoided.</p>
            <p>To complete our responsible dog owner gesture
                without relapse, I insisted on taking the bag the rest of the
              way. With little
                  astonishment we discovered that the shattered and torn shit
              bag was now completely
                  empty.</p>
