            <span class="maincont">Look Ma, only one ski!</span></p>
            <p class="maincont">This tour had it's moments, such
                as when I was digging a snow pit and I knocked my ski over. It
              landed on the steep hill, flat on its base, and flew down the fall
              line
                until it disappeared from sight. Since I'm experienced with
              spending hours looking for runaway skis, I was anxious to chase
              it down.
                But the line which moments ago seemed like a treat now looked
            menacing. </p>
            <p class="maincont">After flailing down
              the best part of the run and learning that I'm a horrible one legged
              powder skier, I found the ski hiding behind a tree. It had caught
              some air and landed like a spear in the snowpack. I recovered the
              run-away beast and triumphantly mounted it to my previously crippled
              feeling foot...</p>
            <p class="maincont">Slim was amazing to watch as he barreled down
              the mountain on his huge swallow tail split board. In his wake,
              a tall plume of powder smoke swirled high into the air. His impressive
              mass combined with his equally impressive speed left me feeling
            both awed and sorry for any tree that tried to cross his path.              </p>
            <p class="maincont">I had seen it happen before; once, on a tour
              with Slim near Mount Aire, he arrived at the bottom of the run
              in an ecstatic state. He recounted how he had narrowly survived
              a scrape with a tree as he picked pine shards off his jacket and
              searched for tears. The way he told it, a little tree had practically
              jumped out in front of him, leaving him no choice but to barrel
              through it. We laughed at the encounter, but as we hiked back up
              the hill side following Slim's down track, we saw the enormity
              of story. </p>
            <p class="maincont">Before we got
              anywhere near the tree he had collided with, we began to see the
              debris. Light debris at first, but soon the slope was blanketed
              in a remarkable littering of mulched pine branches, twigs, cones
              and needles. This fresh scattering of pine scented organics stretched
              impressively from where we stood up to a massive pine tree, 100
              feet up the hill.
              The bottom right side of the pine looked like it had been hit sideways
              by an avalanche. The branches that had been there earlier were
              completely removed, all the way to the thick trunk. But this was
              no avalanche path, it was Slim's path, and it was equally impressive... </p>
            <p class="maincont">The middle part of our descent from Raymond Glades,
              which I usually consider to be the crux of the run as it involves
              the most bushwacking and potential to get lost, was good skiing
              and quite uneventful. Slim cleared a path as he went, and I  stayed
              out of the way. </p>
            <p class="maincont">Near the bottom, we sped down the Porter Fork
              road passing waves of pained looking backcountry travelers. Still
              a good distance from the trailhead, Slim stopped to pick up a brown
              bag of doggie poop that he had bagged earlier on our way up. Gingerly
              carrying the bulging sack off to his side, he picked up speed
              and resumed his hurtling pace down the iced over  road.
              I gave him and the poop wide berth and followed behind.</p>
            <p class="maincont">Once we reached peak speed, Slim's huge
                split board balked at the frozen snow. Suddenly, he went down
              hard. I'm not sure if he cartwheeled or just slid but his tumble
              definitely went the distance because he had left a long tapering
              streak of dog turd brown that went on for nearly thirty feet. I
              did my best to avoid the menacing stripes and splattered clumps
              while keeping an eye on the sky for any nuggets that might still
              be airborne. At the terminus of the rubble, Slim lay on the ground,
              frantically checking his body, not for broken parts, but for brown
              smears and smudges, all while saying, &quot;Euwe! euwe!
              euwe!&quot; </p>
            <p class="maincont">I was glad that he was okay, but not really excited
              about driving home with a stinky, poopie coated passenger. Incredibly,
              we discovered that he had escaped the carnage mostly unscathed,
              and had a hearty laugh before continuing down, now with a half
              full brown bag.</p>
            <p class="maincont">They say lightning never strikes the same place
              twice. That's why I could hardly believe my eyes when once again
              Slim's board seemed to just grab an edge and throw him off the
              trail onto the ground. This time he sped dangerously close to a
              patch of trees and the flowing creek. I swerved to avoid the new,
              slightly shorter but not less impressive brown streak and to help
              inspect for defiled body parts. Again, we had good laugh at the
              fact that a dreaded fecal smearing had once again been mostly
              avoided.</p>
            <p class="maincont">To complete our responsible dog owner gesture
              without relapse, I insisted on taking the bag the rest of the way.
              With little astonishment, I picked it up, discovering that the
              shattered and torn bag was now completely empty.</p>
