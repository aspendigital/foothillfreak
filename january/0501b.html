              Avy danger was high, the visibility was low, the powder was encased
              in  variable, hard wind slabs; at least the winds were blowing
              60 mph, keeping things interesting... We started with a group of
              8 which dwindled to a core of 5 perverts who stuck around mostly
              to watch each other suffer and to see who would be next to cry
              &quot;uncle&quot;. Three of us were blown down flat by gusts that would suddenlty
              blast you with hard flying crusts, graupel and miscelaneous blasted
              free tree parts. The Powder Princess wins for being blown down
            twice, though </p>

              </span> The avy report said that storm totals from the past 4
                days are 3 to 5&#8217; in
                the Cottonwoods, but there was little over a foot from that period
              in the Porter Fork area. We skied up the Bowman
                fork
                trail, took some runs in the cabin shot area, dug a snow pit
                on belay, summitted, and skied a long line down into gobblers
                through
              challenging wind
                drifts and powdery debris that had our quads screaming by the
                end. We hit the car at dark, 6:00. <span class="icct">ICCT: 2 hand hits
