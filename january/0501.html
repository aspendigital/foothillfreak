              </span>Morning half day in the fork where our team was a bit slow
              moving from the previous days schenanagens. Sore hip flexors weren't
              enough
              to discourage some poor route finding that ended with us booting
              up some of worst snow imaginable. Another wave of
              fog socked us in so dense trees became our best evacuation route.
              Helmut
              instigated
              some creative switchback cutting near the end of the trail which
              led to some entertaining ski acrobatics and quality one on
            one with the local shrubbery.</p>

              Definite sundowner of a day. Though I feared the dreaded Utah &quot;dust
              on crust&quot; syndrome, these areas were well filled in and presented
              some fantastic skiing. By the time we arrived in upper days, ALL
              my favorite &quot;secret&quot; lines  had been skied. The more
              standard,
              open
              shots
              were
              untracked?
              We
              went straight to main days to find some solitude, but arrived at
              the same time as several other groups. After a couple runs we planned
              to hit banana Days to escape the hords, but the hords started heading
              to Banana
              days too,
              so we decided to bail out of Days entirely and head into Cardiff
              Via the Hallway, which we discovered some others had decided as
              well...
              When we arrived in Cardiff Fork, we had it all to ourselves. Only
              a few mysteriously erratic lines marred the face of the flakes
              so
              under
              a clear, mostly
              sunny sky we headed up. With each step, the visibility noticeably
              deteriated. By the time we reached the pass into
              Mineral, we were completely socked in. The fact the the sun seemed
              to be setting didn't really cheer us up either. But after a few
              patient moments, in which some finger pointing occured, a slight
              window of visibility appeared. We dropped, and were estatic to
              find that after a few turns, we came out of the cloud and were
              staring down 1000 vertical of perfectly visible creamy powder.
              At the bottom we rejoyced, geared up, and feeling quite satisfied,
              toured up to Cardiff peak. As we hit the summit, the christmas
              lights on the snow station were shining brightly through a foggy,
              deep blue dusk. We skied fun breakable crusts 
            by headlamp all the way to the van.</p>

Now that I've read a bit more of the manual, I figured that white pine would
be an excellent place to test out my new Sony Cyber Shot camera. To avoid the
heli poopers, we veered towards redpine instead. First, though, we marveled at
the new Scotties bowl slide path. It's so amazing to see such a familiar place
completely re-arranged, mowed, devastated and all sorts of other adjectives.
Nature is so amazing...</p>

            I volunteered Helmut to lead this part of the traverse.</p>

              The Evil Dr. Fu Manchu took a 50 foot slide for life which was
                a perfect opportunity to test out the new rapid fire mode on
                my camera. As you can see in the third frame, the Dr. recovered
            quite nicely.</p>

            </span>I've always looked at these mountains on my way back from
            Durango, but have never had the time to explore them. This time we
            succumbed to the mystery and went for a quick, exploratory tour,
            starting near the old &quot;Blue Mountain&quot; ski resort. Turns
            out, these mountains aren't as shrouded in mystery as they are shrouded
            in dense foilage! If I was a local Abajo Mountain skier, I'd definitely
            invest in a good chainsaw. Once you've clawed your way through the
            bushes the views are spectacular, with the La Sals to the north,
            red rocks in between and the tasty San Juans to the east. Check It
            out, bring eye protection!<span class="location"></span></p>

                days are 3 to 5&#8217; in
                the Cottonwoods, but there was little over a foot from that period
              in the Porter Fork area. We skied up the Bowman
                fork
                trail, took some runs in the cabin shot area, dug a snow pit
                on belay, summitted, and skied a long line down into gobblers
                through
              challenging wind
                drifts and powdery debris that had our quads screaming by the
