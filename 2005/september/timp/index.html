          Timpanogos. </span><span class="Header"><br />
        </span><span class="maincont">The idea has been in the back of my head
        for years. A handful of summers I even gave a it a half assed
        attempt, yet failed miserably. But this year, I finally pulled it together
        and skied 12 months in a row. </span></p>

        <span class="maincont">Oh, blessed snow patch! We weren't planning on
          seeing snow here. But when we did it meant that we'd be cutting our
        massive planned dry land approach and descent in half. It's between Wooly
        Hole and the Giant Staircase drainage, but since it saved us over 3 hrs.
        of hiking, I think it should be called &quot;Cheater Patch Basin&quot;. </span></p>

         <span class="maincont">Kulio and Foothill bask in the post September
            skiing glory. </span></p>
      <p class="maincont">We skied 3 runs on the rock studded snow  patch, favoring
        a partly white section that provided about 400 vertical feet of land
        mine hopping action. At the end of the third run  I
        took my skis off for the last time of &quot;the year&quot;. I was tired.
        Switching back to running shoes and stowing my boots was difficult. The
        energy dropped, but the euphoria rose. 12 months. Hundreds of different
        lines. Dozens of quality accomplices. A handful of different mountain
        ranges. And countless people wondering why I was hiking with skis on
        my back in the middle of the summer.</p>
      <p class="maincont">But I felt justified. Each experience was self powered,
        self plotted, and unique. I had never really thought beyond the sillyness
        of the task, but upon it's completion, I felt an amazing sense of accomplishment.        </p>
      <p class="maincont">The hike from 9,000 ft. back to the trailhead seemed
        effortless, as if the whole year was one huge hike, one 100,000 vertical
        trek, and now I had just one last mile to go. I floated down, hands in
        pockets, soaring over the rocky switchbacks and open meadows, my pack
        incredibly light, my stride long. It was a questionable journey that
        I had first dreamed of over a decade ago, and I'd finally finished it.</p>
      <p class="maincont">I was satisified.  Righteous. Ready to gloat.
        At home, I walked into the kitchen like an olympian, arms reaching for
        the ceiling, shredded, dirt caked skis  in one hand, filthy,
        tattered backpack in the other. I might have said something like &quot;I
        am a year round skiing stud&quot; or some other mantra to that effect.
        My roomate was obviously impressed, though I don't think his eyes left
        the computer.</p>
      <p class="maincont">I checked my voice mail. First message was from Powder
        Princess, eagerly requesting a full report on the trip. It was sad that
        she couldn't have been there, but excellent to hear her support and excitement.
        Second message was The Swindler. He had called at 11:00 AM saying, &quot;well,
        I figured that you'd given up on your totally lame ski adventure by now
        and would probably be up for a bike ride. Call me. &quot; </p>
      <p class="maincont">I fell asleep laughing. </p>
      <p><span class="Header">The Beta on Year
          Round Skiing </span><span class="maincont"><br />
          Interested in skiing every month of the year?
          It's easy and it's hard. I'd say that the crux month is probably june
          or july. That's when it's easiest to loose your momentum and get caught
          up in summer diversions. Kayaking, biking, running, motorcycling, long
          games of chess at the coffee shop: compared to skiing, these pursuits
          are dangerous and downright distracting. </span></p>
      <p><span class="maincont">But, if you can manage to break the spell of
          summer, as well as ignore your jeering friends, you'll find
          skiing in J</span><span class="maincont">une and July to be one of
          the most summery things you can do. Then in August and September you'll
          find that your previous months investments of effort and ego can easily
          carry you the rest of the way through the year, to complete stardom,
          and beyond. </span></p>
