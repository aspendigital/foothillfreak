      <p><span class="Header"><span class="caption">King's Peak Sniffer Summit.</span><br />
          </span><span class="maincont">As I suddenly found myself at Labor Day
          weekend without a single thing to do, I headed off to King's Peak,
          where a co-worker and her boyfriend were backpacking. I figured that
          if I timed it right, I could find their camp just in time for tequila
          hour.</span></p>
      <p><img src="DSC00981.jpg" width="600" height="458" /><br />
        <span class="maincont">Here I am giving Star Child a celebratory noogie
        on top of Kings Peak. It was eerily lonesome uptop the desolate summit,
        as if I had passed
          into a zone where Humans are not permitted.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img src="DSC00971.jpg" width="600" height="450" /><br />
        <span class="maincont">Actually, the summit was a major labor day weekend
        party zone. If you weren't careful, you'd end up being photographer for
        the other euphoric peak-baggers. Several folks asked me to take a series
        of
        group pictures with an assortment of poses and
           cameras. Then, before I could run away, I was asked to pose
        with Star Child  with a yet another group of beaming, shivering strangers.
        Probably the most amazing thing I heard was someone say, &quot;sea level
        yesterday, on top of Kings Peak today!&quot;.</span></p>

      <p><img src="DSC00983.jpg" width="600" height="450" /><br />
        <span class="maincont">We had hiked for 14
        hrs by  6:00 Saturday evening. We were both totally
        spent. Star Child, walking as if she was wearing lead booties
        on each
        paw, was
        even too tired
          to eat. We snuggled through a couple night storms and some suprisingly
          low temperatures. The monday sun was a welcome event, providing me
        with the first warmth of the weekend, perfect for the final couple hours
        back to the trail head.</span></p>
