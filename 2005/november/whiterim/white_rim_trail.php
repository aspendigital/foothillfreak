            <p><span class="caption">3 Days on the White Rim Trail</span><br />
              The freak has been scheming to ride his BMW f650 from Salt Lake,
                around the White Rim trail and back. But would it be possible?
                He decided the best way to scope it out would be to  ride
                it first on a self powered bike backed up by a
                fully overloaded support vehicle. There was more
                food, wet wipes and diapers than we could ever hope to consume
                in three days, but hey, that's life on the edge of the white
            rim. </p>

              Sunset of day 2. A touching moment before
                the kitchen zar  forced us to eat pesto
                pasta with fresh pine nuts, parmesan, wine and a side of creamy
                tomato minestra. The rigors of camping aren't for everyone. </p>

              <span>What's tha Matta with you?.. Our camp on
                  Murphy's hog back. Someone drank too much and walked off a
                  60 ft cliff here a week earlier. After checking out a tent
              site right on the edge of the cilff, I opted for one a little further
              inland.</span>            </p>

                <span>On the morning of our last day I woke
                up really having to go to the bathroom. Then I saw this amazing
                orange light and grabbed my camera. I managed to only take two
                shots before the warm glow completely dissappeared.            </span></p>

                <span>The White Rim locals are waaaay tough.
                Whatever you do, don't look them in the eye...</span></p>
            <p>Well, the white rim  2005 ride was a total
                success. So successful that, unfortunately, there aren't any
                epic stories to tell. It's enough to make you want to go and
                ride all 100 miles in one day so you have something to report.
              Or, if you're really dying for a good story, feel free to borrow
              one of my roomates motorcycles and ride it across mussleman arch.
              I dare you. Extra points for riding a wheelie. </p>
            <p>As for riding the Beemer on the trail? It would
              be a fun way to travel the area, camp and spend more time hiking
              and running the trails. Some of the sand traps would be tricky
              with a 400 lb. bike so a little training on the dunes of
              the little sahara state park are in order. But that will have to
              wait. It's going to be ski season any second now... </p>
