                <span>Finally, the south side corned up and
                was ready to rip. Powder Princess was excited to try out her
                new birthday crampons on some early morning ice, but by the time
                everyone was picked up and errands were done, the snow was soft
                enough that we didn't really need them. The middle apron was
                so strewn with ice nuggets that it felt more like sumo wrestling
                than skiing, but the bottom apron had some great, smooth corn
            for the tasting.</span></p>
