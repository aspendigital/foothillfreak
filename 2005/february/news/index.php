              on National News!</h1>
                <h6>February 22nd, 2005</h6>
                <p>The foothill freak and his team
                were featured on the CBS news tonight. When approached by a reporter
                and film crew in the White Pine parking lot before a tour a few
                weeks ago, most of our media weary crew ran for cover. However,
                Teem Freek Public Relations Executive Director Professor Ragdoll
                stepped up to the camera to field a few questions. We all gave
                him shit for it afterward, but tonight as we watched the news
            we felt a small victory for experienced backcountry freeks everywhere.</p>
            <p>There, on the screen before us, as well
                as on screens all across the country, was Professor Ragdoll.
                We Cheered! The clip was brilliant. His line, which will go down
                in backcountry skiing history, was this: &quot;we've got beacons,
                probes and shovels&quot;. </p>
            <p>How Provocative!</p>
            <p>Run-ins with the media can be fun after all!
              Next time Teem Freek runs into a reporter doing a story on avalanches
              we all agreed that we would share with the world what else we carry
              for avy safety: twine, small portable chain saws, Village People&#8482; costumes,
            a 12 gauge shot gun, and a case of PBR!</p>
