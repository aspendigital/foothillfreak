  Slide in Main Porter Fork.</p>
            <p>              <span class="caption">Main Porter with a West Porter home run</span><br />
              Hey, when something is good once, it's often good twice! Starchild
                  raged a full 6000 vert today like it was nothing. Ahh, the
                  mid winter spoils of being
      in shape. Main Porter had a recent natural slide that we happily skied
                  around. However, the gnarliest moment of the day was driving
            up Mill Creek Canyon. </p>
            <p> There is one corner that is notorious for black
              ice, and today was no exception. PowderPrincess was behind the
              wheel of the WeenerWagon. She was hauling so much ass that Foothill
              didn't even have the chance to utter the sage advice &quot;SLOW
              THE FUCK DOWN!&quot; A jogger, sensing disaster, dove off the road
              and into a snowbank. Then it happened. The WeenerWagon lost traction
              in its rear end and it swung free out to the side. Then began the
              pendulum effect and the truck began swinging back and forth, back
              and forth. The Princess was wildly spinning the wheel trying to
              recover. She spun it madly to the right, then madly to the left,
              as if she was sugar bombed child fevorishly spinning a fake steering
              wheel, controlling nothing but determined anyway.</p>
            <p>But The Princess expertly kept us on the pavement,
              out of the way of trees, creek, snowbanks and other suddenly perilous
              looking obstacles. Eventually the truck grabbed back onto the road
              and we got back into our lane in time for the oncoming traffic
              to safely pass. Phew!</p>
            <p>By the time we got to the trail head the adrenalin
              had subsided and we had already laughed it off. But when we opened
              the flat bed cap rear door, we were greeted by a battered Starchild.
              The poor pooch had slammed into something and had a bloody gash
              under her eye as well as a bad case of the shivers. After a thurough
              checking by a wilderness first responder, a physical therapist,
              a nursing student, and an emergency room doc (all Teem Freek members),
              StarChild was verified &quot;good to go&quot; and she happily sprung
              off the gate into another beautiful day in the Wasatch.</p>
