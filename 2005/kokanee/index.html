              2005</span></p>
            <p class="maincont">Going new places and trying new things is good.
              That's how we ended up at the Kokanee Glacier Cabin in British
              Columbia, north of Nelson. It was a lot of planning, organizing
              and debating over wether we should hire a
              cook
              or
              not, but we pulled it off. (without a cook, or guide for that matter).</p>
            <p class="maincont"> Folks on their
                way out of the cabin told us that the conditions were the worst
              they had seen in twenty years. Lucky for us, recent and constant
              snowing gave
              us wonderful
              powder skiing every day. There was so much snowing going on, in
              fact, we ended up stuck in the cabin for 2 extra days as we waited
              for the weather to clear and a heli to pick us up.</p>
            <p class="maincont">The Avy conditions never dropped below considerable
              danger, so we never were able to push big lines or tour up to the
              glacier. However, we never had a shortage of excitement as whoomping
              and
              class 2 avalanches accompanied us in many locations. With poor
              visibility and fast snow, it was an excellent week to practice
              tree skiing anyway.</p>
            <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>            <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00425.jpg" width="405" height="500" /><br />
            We tried to squish a rental cart with our gear in Spokaine but it
              didn't work.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00019.jpg" width="600" height="423" /><br />
            We still had pleanty of room in the rental van so we hit the liquor
              store and filled it up the rest of the way.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00022.jpg" width="600" height="461" /><br />
            Helm&uuml;t was really sick on the way up. Although he never came out
              of his sleeping bag during the packing stage, he continually attempted
              to remain helpful.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00029.jpg" width="600" height="450" /><br />
            Although you may feel strange walking around in ski boots without
              a drop of snow to be seen anywhere, you feel validated when the
              heli arrives.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00037.jpg" width="600" height="450" /><br />
            This is where we were dropped off in our own private Kokanee.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;          </p>          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00443.jpg" width="600" height="406" /><br />
            Here's the little shack where we roughed it for 9 days. We affectionately
              dubbed it &quot;the mothership&quot;.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;          </p>          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00051.jpg" width="600" height="450" /><br />
            Here's some hot chicks we found hiding in the trees above the cabin...
              <br />
              No, actually it's telechick, twig-a-licious, and powder princess,
              on skis finally.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00075.jpg" width="600" height="450" /><br />
            Here the trip organizers have a gruelling debate over where to ski
              the next day.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00344.jpg" width="600" height="450" /><br />
            Our little cabin was always easy to find at the end of the day as
            it's next to a big lake and  has a big red circle around it.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>

            in the cabin, reaching for the asprin.</p>

            Each member of the team has a distinct signature.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00114.jpg" width="600" height="450" /><br />
            Helm&uuml;t and Pow Princess smiling for some reason..</p>

            Here's the slide Helm&uuml;t set off after a reassuringly stable ski cut.
              (Humans included to show scale). It's great when people set off
              avalanches
              because afterward they're always willing to let you ski first.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00509.jpg" width="600" height="428" /><br />
            This is the slide that Powder Princess set off and rode for a bit.
              (Those are her turns into and out of the path). When you watch
              a loved one tumbling in an avalanch, the memory burns quite clearly
              into
              your
              mind. </p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00496.jpg" width="376" height="500" /><br />
            A nicely placed ski cut by Helm&uuml;t set off this long running slide.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00159.jpg" width="600" height="450" /><br />
            Looking at the toe of the glacier. Another time...</p>

            Big mountains look so small in photos.</p>

            Here's the old, fabled Slocan Chief Cabin. This hut was in use up
              to just a few years ago. The poor folks who stayed here had to
              use an outhouse!</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00164.jpg" width="600" height="445" /><br />
            Figure 8ing tracks is challenging when your 8ing turns that are
            half the radius of your own.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>

            After skiing a run about 5 times,  on our last run I noticed
              something in the trees. Upon closer inspection we discovered this
              sad tribute to a skier who was in an avalanche and &quot;skied into
              the great white from this spot&quot;. A reminder to pay the mountians
            due respect, and expect no respect in return.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00242.jpg" width="600" height="470" /><br />
Here's the crew in a picture the night before the day we thought we were leaving:
  TeleChick, FarLeft, Evil Dr. Fu Manchu, Foothill, PowderPrincess, TwigLicious,
  Helm&uuml;t, Prof Ragdoll, Boris, and Natasha.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00251.jpg" width="600" height="479" /><br />
            The day we were to be flown out there was a major storm with bad
              visibility. We remained on standby until 4:30, Hoping
              for a clearing. It never
              came. As
              seen in this picture, there may have been moments of boredom as
              we waited....</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC01011.jpg" width="413" height="550" /><br />

          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00571.jpg" width="413" height="550" /><br />
            And to pass the time we played games.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00338.jpg" width="600" height="453" /><br />
            And more games.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC01026.jpg" width="413" height="550" /><br />
            Here's Marzy, the hut costodian. Besides being hairy and informative,
              it was a pleasure to be stuck in a cabin for two days with him.
            Thanks for everything Marzy! Come visit the land of Zion soon.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00564.jpg" width="600" height="450" /><br />
            This is the whole hut custodian family. I suppose they get bored
            sometimes too.</p>
          <p class="maincont">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="maincont"><img src="images/DSC00380.jpg" width="600" height="450" /><br />
              Alas, we did eventually leave the hut and return to the life of
                the low-lander. And the pains of returning to work make planning
                next
            year's trip to Canada that much easier...</p>
