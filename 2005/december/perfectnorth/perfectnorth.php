            <h1>Perfect North Slopes, Indiana </h1>

			  <p>I knew no one would believe me so I had
              to take a picture of the massive avalanche that occured at Perfect
              North Slopes, near Lawrenceburgh, Indiana. If you look closely,
              you will see that the 4th lift tower up on the left side has been
              knocked over. The second one on the right was also damaged (see
              the crew working on it) but you can't tell from this perspective.
              Skiing in Indiana is super gnarly</p>

              <p>If you like off piste skiing, Idiana is probably not for you...</p>

              <p>Here is a typical scene from  ski slopes
              of the Ohio River Valley: 2 out of 4 riders are just standing around,
              1 out of 4 riders have opted to walk down, and finally, 1 out of
              4 riders are actually riding. That's my niece, Rachel, BTW. She's
              sporting a early 1980's Bogner ski outfit complete with no skid
              knee and elbow pads that was discovered in a neighbors closet in
              Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
