              <span class="maincont">Found a little solitude up past Main Porterfork, just to the west
              of Mount Raymond. With a few inches of dry new snow on top, the
            skiing was incredible.</span></p>

            <span class="maincont">The Powder Porpoise after laying some tracks. </span></p>
            <p class="maincont">To get the most out of the  home run, I thought
              West Porter would be the way to go. Unfortunately, as the trail
              over to the pass wasn't broken and it was late in the day, I feared
              that I might not make it in time. Bad visibility and a couple of
              blinding gusts helped me loose my bearings a couple times, but
              the thought of dropping into an untracked West Porter Fork kept
              me struggling along. When I made it to the pass,  it was obvious
              that the sun had set. But there was still enough light to see that
              the area had been tracked out worse than I had ever seen before.
              It felt a bit as if I had broken trail through a pristine backcountry
              to get &quot;in area&quot; for a choppy, moguly, and icey home run. Not to
              mention that the bottom of West Porter  was horrible as the
              weine wackers were out in force, and the very last 200ft had
              under a foot of coverage.</p>
            <p class="maincont">But it's all good. Time and Ptex heal most wounds.
              It was pitch black when I got to the freakmobile, the porpoise
              was thuroughly pooped, and adventure had been had. </p>
