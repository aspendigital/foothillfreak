            <h1>Toledo Bowl Solo</h1>
			<h6>May 14th, 2005</h6>
			<p class="caption">The one and only May
                tour</p>
              <p>Well, this time of year it always get's
              harder and harder to find folks to ski with, so today I headed
            out with only me, myself and the freak. 
                </p>
              </p>
              <p>But I wasn't alone. I saw this marvelous
                moth on the way up. It had died, and as the sun heated up it's
                carcass it melted itself into a deep snow pocket. It seemed so
                spectacular and unique that I took a picture. Then I started
                to notice them all over the place and it didn't seem so special
                anymore...</p>
            <p>I wasn't alone on the way down either. There
              were tons of chimpmunks that would pop out of the snow like ground
              hogs and scurry about when they saw me coming. I couldn't help
              myself so I decided to chase a few, though their short legs were
              hardly a match for me + gravity + fast corn. I chased one for about
              5 turns until I had to choose between making tighter turns, running
              him over, or going a different direction entirely. Of course, making
              tighter turns really wasn't an option...</p>
            <p>I was chasing another critter and when I was
              about 3 feet away, he dove into a hole, completely vanishing. I
              hope he was having as much fun as I was. I suppose this was my
              way to get back at nature for the grouse attacks I suffered through
              last year...</p>
