            <p><br />
              <span>Thanks goes out to  Powstash and Trackhead  for the inspiration
            on this route.</span></p>
            <p><span> To allow for maximum sleepage, we slept
              in Helmut's van at the trail head. What we didn't
              know then, but know now, is not to try to sleep there. The dry
              canyon trail head parking lot is a thriving late night hotspot
              for &quot;star gazers&quot; and for throwing used condoms out the
              window.</span></p>
          <p>In the darkness of 5 am we hit the trail. Then,
            at about 5:30 we realized that we weren't on the trail at all, but
            were bushwacking through dry canyon creek. The proper trail was high
            above us to the north. Once we regained the proper route our thoughts
            turned towards when we would reach the snow line so we could lighten
            our packs. Unfortunately we had to gain just under 2000 vtf before
            we could strap on the boards. From there it was challenging skinning
            and the occasional cramponing directly up our descent route.</p>

            <span>Helmut acting like he's sponsored by atomic
              before dropping in from the summit ridge.</span>
            </p>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><img src="timpDSC00239.jpg" width="600" height="422" /><br />
            <span>Beautimus line to return to and ski next
              year. We watched someone ski the line alone. His loudly icy sounding
              turns weren't comforting.</span>
            </p>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><img src="timpDSC00241.jpg" width="375" height="500" /><br />
            <span>Here's the really scary line we skied and
              a huge orange arrow. The skiing from the top would have been good
              corn if we waited about 2 hours till 1:00. We waited about 5 minutes,
              got bored and skied the ice. Probably a good thing as the corn
              below was just perfect.</span>
            </p>
          </p>

          <p><img src="timpsteep.jpg" width="425" height="500" /><br />
            <span>Dude, it was, like, so steep! It was like
              80 degrees! Here's proof!</span>
            </p>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><img src="timpDSC00257.jpg" width="600" height="463" /><br />
            <span>I likes corn, and it looks like helm&uuml;t
              does too.</span>
            </p>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><img src="timpDSC00259.jpg" width="600" height="481" /><br />
            <span>The real crux of the skiing came down low
              on a terminally ill snow vein. There were intermittent gap jumps
              and really pointy sticks.</span>
            </p>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><img src="timpDSC00261.jpg" width="500" height="460" /><br />
            <span>Helmut experimented with riding across a
              steep mud embankment. Suprisingly, his skies stopped dead in the
              dirt and he launched into the best cartwheel down a rocky slope
              I've seen since mountainbiking season. If only I had the camera
              out!</span>
            </p>

            <span>Ya see all sorts on the Dry Canyon trail.
              But if you don't see any freaks, then you're the freak. </span>
