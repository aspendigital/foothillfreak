              <span class="caption">Teem Freek is featured on national news!<br />
              </span><span class="maincont">The foothill freak and his team were
              featured on the CBS news tonight. When approached by a reporter
              and film crew in the White Pine parking lot before a tour a few
              weeks ago, most of our
              media
              weary crew ran for cover. However, Teem Freek Public Relations
              Executive Director Professor Ragdoll stepped up to the camera to
              field a few questions. We all gave him shit for it afterward, but
              tonight as we
              watched
              the news we felt a small victory for experienced backcountry freeks
            everywhere.</span></p>
            <p><span class="maincont">There, on the screen before us, as well
                as on screens all across the country, was Professor Ragdoll.
                We Cheered! The clip was brilliant. His line, which  will go
                down
                in backcountry
                skiing
                history,
                was this: &quot;we've got beacons, probes and shovels&quot;. </span></p>            
            <p class="maincont">How Provocative!</p>
            <p><span class="maincont">Then someone in the editing room had
                  a stroke of genius. Next to Professor R's statement they placed
                a  clip of  an avalanche survivor standing in front of the canyon
                in which he nearly perished. Here's his line: &quot;I
                didn't have a beacon or shovel or probe&quot;. </span></p>
            <p><span class="maincont">I hope he was
                  glad to be on national tv too!</span></p>            
            <p class="maincont">Runs in with the media can be fun after all!
              Next time Teem Freek runs into a reporter doing a story on avalanches
              we all agreed that
              we would share with the world what else we carry for avy safety:
               twine, small portable chain saws, Village People&#8482; costumes,
               a 12 gauge shot gun, and a case of PBR!</p>

              Slide in Main Porter Fork. We didn't have anything to do with it.
                Honest.</p>
            <p class="maincont"><span class="location">Monday the 21st</span><br />
              <span class="caption">Main Porter with a West Porter home run</span><br />
              Hey, when something is good once, it's often good twice! Starchild
              raged a full 6000 vert today like it was nothing. Ahh, the mid
              winter spoils
              of being in shape. Main Porter had a recent natural slide that
              we happily skied around. However, the gnarliest moment of the day
              was driving
            up Mill Creek Canyon. </p>
            <p class="maincont"> There is one corner that is notorious for
              black
              ice,
              and today was no exception. PowderPrincess was behind the wheel
              of the WeenerWagon. She was hauling so much ass that Foothill didn't
              even have the chance to utter the sage advice &quot;SLOW THE
              FUCK DOWN!&quot; A
               jogger, sensing disaster, dove off the road and into a snowbank.
              Then it happened. The WeenerWagon lost traction in its rear end
              and it
              swung free out to the side. Then began the pendulum effect
              and the truck began swinging 
              back
              and forth,
               back and forth. The Princess was wildly spinning the
              wheel trying to recover. She spun it madly to the right, then madly
              to the left, as if she was sugar bombed child fevorishly spinning
              a fake steering wheel, controlling
              nothing
              but determined
              anyway.</p>
            <p class="maincont">But The Princess expertly kept us on the pavement,
              out of the way of trees, creek, snowbanks and other suddenly perilous
              looking obstacles. Eventually the truck grabbed back onto the road
              and we got back into our lane in time for the oncoming traffic
              to safely pass. Phew!</p>
            <p class="maincont">By the time we got to the trail head the adrenalin
              had subsided and
              we
              had
              already
              laughed
              it off.
              But
              when
              we opened
              the flat bed cap rear door, we were greeted by a battered Starchild.
              The poor pooch had slammed into something and had a bloody gash
              under her eye as well as a bad case of the shivers. After a thurough
              checking by a wilderness first responder, a physical therapist,
              a nursing student, and an emergency room doc (all  Teem Freek members),
              StarChild was verified &quot;good to go&quot; and she happily sprung
              off the gate into another beautiful day in the Wasatch.</p>

              We skied it in crappy breakable crust last thursday, and in heavenly,
              light, bottomless powder today. Welcome to Utah! Check out some

              Soft snow. Star Child was happy. The view down Whipple Fork
            was exciting, but it probably need a few more feet of snow, like
            20!</p>

              Helm&uuml;t rests, 2 thirds of the way down the Coalpit headwall. <br />
              Mysterious
                clouds veil our perilous ski out, or something like that.</p>

Gee, Foothill has only been drooling over this line since he came to Utah 14
years
ago. Twas about time. Now He'll have to go back and ski it in good conditions.
On the
lower apron I was carving up some thin breakable crust when my right ski hit
a hidded ice nugget bomb and blew the heel out of my dynafit. Remind me to tighten
those things down. <a href="../downloads/index.html">Watch a video</a>.</p>
